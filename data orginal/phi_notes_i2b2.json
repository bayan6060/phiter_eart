About a week ago he slipped on\nthe driveway at home and sustained an injury to his left ankle. \nHe was seen at Tri-City Hospital and was told he had a\nfracture.  He was placed in an air splint and advised to be\npartial weight bearing, and he is using a cane.  He is here for\nroutine follow-up. \nPast medical history is notable for no ankle injuries previously. \nHe has a history of diabetes and sleep apnea.  He takes Prozac,\nCardizem, Glucophage and Amaryl.  He is also followed by Dr. Harold\nNutter for an arrhythmia.  He does not smoke.  He drinks\nminimally.  He is a set designer at Columbia Pictures.\n \nOn examination today he has slight tenderness of the left ankle\nabout four fingerbreadths above the malleolus.  The malleolus is\nnon-tender medially or laterally with no ligamentous tenderness\neither.  Dorsal flexion and plantar flexion is without pain. \nThere is no significant swelling.  There are no some skin changes\nwith some small abrasions proximally.  There is no fibular\ntenderness proximally.  No anterior pain is noted.  No hindfoot,\nmidfoot or forefoot tenderness is noted. \nI would like him to use a tube sock with his air cast.  He is\nusing a cane for ambulation.  His x-rays do not show a notable\nfracture pattern today, and we will await the Radiology opinion. \nI would like him to stay in the air splint with the sock.  I will\nsee him back in six weeks for review at the Boxborough office. \n \n \nDiagnosis:  Left ankle fracture.\n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________________________\nHabib Valenzuela, M.D.\n \nHV/kuntz\nMmedical\n \ncc:  Harlan Oneil, M.D.\n     \n     Harold Nutter, M.D.\n     Doctors Hospital North\n     64 Bruce St\n     Omak, GA 72196\n \nHabib Valenzuela, M.D.\n \nDD: 02/12/06\nDT: 02/17/06\nDV: 02/12/06\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\n\n\n\n",

The \n\npatient was seen by the Emergency Medicine resident.  I have \n\ndiscussed the management with the resident.  I have also seen the \n\npatient primarily and reviewed the medical record.  This is a brief \n\naddendum to the medical record.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Briefly, this is a 45-year-old \n\nmale who complains of several days of nausea, vomiting, and left \n\nlower quadrant discomfort.  He also describes intermittent chest \n\npain, which he has had for a number of months without significant \n\nchange.  He was sent in from his primary care doctor today with \n\nthis pain and was also noted to have some EKG changes.  The patient \n\nhas no chest pain at the time of evaluation in the emergency \n\ndepartment and no shortness of breath.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As indicated and otherwise negative.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As indicated in the chart.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As indicated in the chart.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient is very \n\nwell-appearing, a smiling, very pleasant gentleman in no acute \n\ndistress.  The blood pressure is 119/90, the pulse 82, and the \n\ntemperature 97.9 degrees.  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  The chest \n\nis clear to auscultation.  The heart has a regular rate and rhythm. \n\nThe abdomen is soft.  He has left lower quadrant tenderness.  He \n\nalso, of note on cardiovascular examination, has a soft murmur \n\nwhich he says he has had since childhood.  The extremities are \n\nnormal.  The neurologic examination is non-focal. \n\nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  This is a gentleman with abdominal \n\npain who will receive a CAT scan to rule out diverticulitis.  He \n\nhas also had some non-specific ST changes on his EKG.  He is \n\npain-free at this time.  He does not describe a classic exertional \n\npattern for his chest pain, but given that he is a diabetic and \n\nwith EKG changes, he will also be admitted for rule out MI.  A CT \n\nis pending at the time of this dictation.\n\nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  As above.  The \n\npatient's condition is currently stable. \n\n___________________________________                    CK498/89095 \n\nJAY CARROLL, M.D.  JC72                                 D:03/14/08 \n\n                                                       T:03/14/08 \n\nDictated by:  JAY CARROLL, M.D.  JC72 \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\nRecord date: 2109-09-14\n\n \nSeptember 14, 2109 \n \nVicente Blair, M.D.  \nInternal Medical \nDoctors Hospital North \nOmak, Georgia 72196 \n \nRE: VALDEZ, Harlan \nDHN#: 7672624 \nDATE OF BIRTH: 11/09/2062 \nCURRENT CLINIC VISIT DATE: 09/14/2109 \n \nDear Vicente, \n \nThank you in advance for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan B. Valdez, a 46-year-old male patient with prior polysomnographic evidence of sleep disordered breathing, as well as a history of difficulty in sleep, reinitiation and maintenance and increased early morning awakenings, as well as mixed systemic medical conditions.  \n \nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: As you already know, Mr. Valdez who demonstrates a history of difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance, as well as increased early morning awakenings, has noted an exacerbation of these sleep difficulties, occurring in temporal association with his loss of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year. He is now placed in the unfortunate situation of being a single parent to a 15-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter and describes a modification of his current employment duties of a set designer. In particular, Mr. Valdez describes undergoing on frequent international travelling which has bee markedly curtailed as he is tending to his family situation closer to home.  \n \nHe described a history of intermittent snoring symptomatology but is unaware of specific nocturnal respiratory pauses. He is unaware of a \"restless\" lower limb sensory complaints which may impact on his ability to initiate or reinitiate sleep. He denies a history of a \" night owl\" personality or circadian rhythm dysfunction which may have played a role with respect to nocturnal sleep disruptions or sleep difficulties.   \nHe denies a history of paroxysmal abnormal disturbances or associated narcoleptic symptoms.  \n \nMr. Valdez underwent an initial formal polysomnographic evaluation at the center for sleep diagnostics at Holy Cross on 11/26/05, during which time he was noted to demonstrate a respiratory disturbance index of 81/hour, particularly exacerbated in the supine position and characterized predominantly by hypopneas, with equal distribution during non-REM and stage REM sleep and with associated O2 desaturation Nadir of 88% The respiratory disturbances were predominantly obstructive or mixed hypopneas. In addition, loud snoring was noted.  \n \nThere was evidence of a sleep efficiency of 88% and a short sleep onset latency of 4 minutes. There was a predominance of \"light\" non-REM stages I-II sleep, and a concomitant inability to achieve significant \"slow-wave\" or stage REM sleep. There was also \"alpha intrusions and alpha delta sleep\" evident during the initial sleep study. In addition premature ventricular contractions were noted.  \n \nThe patient underwent a CPAP titration on 01/15/06, also at the Tenacre Foundation Nursing Home in Boxborough, during which time there was a marked reduction in the frequency of hypopneas (respiratory disturbance index equals 2/hour) with CPAP titrations between 4-6 cm. Sleep efficiency improved to 91%, a short sleep onset latency was also noted (3 minutes). There was once again an increased predominance of \"light\" non-REM stage I-II sleep, with concomitant inability to achieve sustained \"slow wave sleep\".  \n \nSince his initial trial of nocturnal CPAP titration (at 6 cm of water pressure) and with various CPAP mask modifications (including CPAP nasal face mask and a Mallinckrodt \"Breeze\" supportive head gear with \"nasal pillows\". The patient describes associated claustrophobic symptomatology, relative difficulties with sustained nocturnal home CPAP use, and difficulties with regards to CPAP to being and complications by the bulkiness of the CPAP machine in general. As a result, he has not utilized nocturnal CPAP therapy for a period of time, although he still maintains the CPAP equipment in his house.  \n \nOf particular note, and exacerbation of the past year, the patient demonstrates increased early morning awakenings (averaging 2-4 in number) with typical awakenings occurring approximately two hours after sleep initiation at 9:30 p.m. (the patient describes one awakening at 11:30 p.m. and the second awakening at 11:45 a.m., of unclear causative etiology). The patient then might awaken at 3 a.m. and be \"ready for the day\".  If he is able to reinitiate sleep thereafter, the patient may demonstrate additional two early morning awakenings after a final awakening at 6 a.m.  \n \nThe patient is noted to have a history of mixed systemic conditions including diabetes, coronary artery disease, depressive disorder, as well as a relatively stable gastrointestinal condition, with no upper GI evidence of gastroparesis.  \n \nMEDICATIONS:  \n1. Provigil 200 mg p.o. q. a.m. PRN.  \n2. Lithium.  \n3. Valproate.  \n4. Glucophage 850 mg t.i.d.  \n5. Humulin 15 units at night.  \n6. Folate.  \n7. Metoprolol.  \n8. Cardia.  \n9. Vitamin E.  \n10. Coated aspirin.  \n \nALLERGIES/ADVERSE REACTIONS: The patient describes an enhancement to suicidal tendencies in association with prior Prozac usage.   \nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies active tobacco or alcoholic beverage usage. He has lost 15-20 pounds over the past several years. His current weight is 195 pounds. He is desirous of losing some additional weight with regards to more regular exercise, but his hectic social situation makes this somewhat difficult at the present time.  \n \nOn examination, the patient demonstrates a blood pressure of 146/88, (seated, left arm), respiratory rate 16.  \n \nHEENT EXAMINATION: Borderline small posterior oropharyngeal aperture, with slightly increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a slightly elongated uvula noted.  \n \nThe patient appears awake, alert, with speech clear and fluent and receptive language function essentially intact. He is presently wearing dental braces. No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated. No focal, sensory, motor or neurologic deficits are noted. No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence. The routine gait appears to be normal based, without evidence of significant gait dystaxias.  No current clinical ictal manifestations are present. No acute evidence of \"micro-sleeps\" are noted.  \n \nIMPRESSION:  \n1. Sleep stage/arrousal dysfunction (780.56): Manifested by subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, increased daytime fatigue and alternating hypersomnia, and recurrent polysomnographic evidence of \"lightened\" sleep pattern, with increased predominance of non-REM stages 1-2 sleep, and with the presence of \"alpha\" intrusions and \"alpha delta\" component to deeper sleep. These latter EEG findings have been described in association with subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, as well as clinical setting of chronic pain related complaints, depressive or anxiety disorder or intercurrent psychotropics agents used (but more usually associated with benzodiazepine or barbituate usage).  \n2. Sleep disordered breathing: As evidenced during prior polysomnographic evaluations, mostly of obstructive and or mixed hypopnea. The patient appears largely refractory to a trial of CPAP therapy, particularly in so far as he demonstrates associated claustrophobic symptoms in association with it's usage, despite relatively modest CPAP water pressures (6 cm). In addition, he has tried various nasal CPAP face mask, including the Mallinckrodt \"Breeze\" supportive head gear with \"nasal pillows\" and with limited success. One might consider repeating a polysomnographic evaluation in the future, and if so, utilizing a potential trial of BIPAP titration, which may help to improve claustrophobic symptoms, but the patient will still be left with the issues referable to \"tangled tubing at night\" and issues referable to nasal face mask usage, as noted above.  3. Relative difficulties in sleep reinitiation and maintenance:  The patient describes at least 2-4 early morning awakenings with difficulty in sleep reinitiation and maintenance, thereby compounding his current sleep problem. While there would logically be a relationship between his current sleep exacerbations and the recent death of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year, there may also be evidence of other nocturnal sleep disturbances for which a repeat polysomnographic evaluation; i.e. in particular looking for the presence of increased spontaneous arousals or limb associated arousals or periodic limb movements of sleep may be of a special clinical benefit.  \n \nPLAN:  \n1. In the short course, in so far as the patient describes himself as being exceedingly tired, and unable to perform the routine daily tasks of work and managing a family in the absence of his deceased wife, I have suggested initiation of PRN Zolpidem tartrate therapy, 5 mg tablets, utilizing one to two tablets p.o.  q. h.s. PRN for difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance.  \n2. The patient is advised to take Zolpidem tartrate therapy no more than 2-3 times per week, in an effort to avoid any issues of physiologic dependency.  \n3. The patient was advised against potential adverse behavioral and or systemic side effects of Zolpidem tartrate therapy including  hypersomnolence, gastric upset, loose stools, diarrhea, and or cardiac palpitations.  \nPending his clinical response of his Zolpidem tartrate therapy, I then might seek direct treatment for his sleep disordered breathing issues which may include a repeat sleep study with potential trial of BIPAP therapy (in an effort to modify or attenuate claustrophobic symptoms). If he proves poorly responsive to trial of BIPAP therapy however, I might consider supplemental O2 therapy at night and, with this in mind a follow up sleep study should have associated end-tidal CO2 monitoring as well.  \n4. In the meantime, the patient was advised to contact the sleep disorders clinic for any acute sleep related concerns in the interim.  \n5. The patient may also benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches with regards to sleep reinitiation such as hypnotherapy, but I will hold off on these strategies pending follow up sleep disorders clinic evaluation (in approximately four months time).   \nOnce again, thank you again for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan Valdez. I hope this letter finds you well.  \n \nSincerely yours, \n \n \nYovani Vergara, M.D.  \nSleep Clinic \nDoctors Hospital North \n \n \ncc: Sleep Clinic DHN \n \nDD:09/14/2109 \nDT:09/15/2109 \nTX:24217     :1991 \n \n\n\n\n\n",

This CP was minimal, but the weakness made him pull over.  He had a repeat of these symptoms day of admission.  His EKG c/w 2/2107 showed flattened T-wave in V2 and TWI in V3 and flattened T-waves in I, aVL. His trop was negative, but MB index was elevated.  Due to T-wave flattening, history and elevated index it was decided to start on heparin and ASA and take to cath lab.  \n\n\n\nCath showed right dominant system with prox Cx 40%, LAD clear, RCA prox 70-80% lesion and ostial PDA 90%.  During final dye injection, pt had VF arrest and 2 shocks.  Pt regained puls and was in AF (new) with RVR. Pt was started on amio.  Pt then began to experience discomfort in the RVR and it was decided to intervene.  POBA was done to ostial PDA.  A first no-eluting stent was placed in prox RCA and pt had dissection and thus 2cd stent was placed.  On admission to CCU, pt still in AF with RVR (120's).  He was on amio drip, BB, loaded on plavix, ASA, lipitor, integrilin and was placed on Avandia study.  His complaint of some mild chest pain (not same as anginal pain day before) thought to be from defibrillation.\n\n\n\nPast Medical History: DMII, hyperchol, bipolar,HTN, depression (s/p ECT)\n\n \n\nMedications on admission: ASA, Lipitor 20, lopressor 50 bid, folate, norvasc 5 qd; lithium, 300 bid; depakote 500 bid; sonata 10 mg qhs, doxylamine 25 qhs, mirtazapine 45 qd \n\n\n\nMeds on Transfer: please see green sheets\n\n \n\nMedications: ASA, Lipitor 20, lopressor 50 bid, folate, norvasc 5 qd; lithium, 300 bid; depakote 500 bid; sonata 10 mg qhs, doxylamine 25 qhs, mirtazapine 45 qd \n\n\n\nAllergies:  NKDA\n\n\n\nFamily History:  family h/o CAD\n\n\n\nSocial History: No EtOH, no tob, no illicits\n\n\n\nReview of Systems:  per HPI\n\n\n\nAllergies:  NKDA\n\n\n\nFamily History:  family h/o CAD\n\n\n\nSocial History: No EtOH, no tob, no illicits\n\n\n\nReview of Systems:  per HPI\n\n\n\nCCU course + plan:\n\n1)\tCards\n\na.\tRhythm - on night of admission patient was started on an esmolol drip as well as amio bloused and rhythm converted to NSR.

Will look for LAE, holter abnl.  Could make a case to anti-coagulate regardless as has had documented afib.  \n\nCV: hold anti-htn meds now.  Continue lipitor at outpt dose.  Allow SBP up to 180.\n\nPSYCH: continue w/ depakote and lithium.

She has been in Rhode Island for \nsix months.  Her complaint is that she has heaviness in the chest.  She \ndoes not have any palpitations.  She does not note that this is \nassociated with exertion.  She does have diaphoresis associated with it.  \nShe does not have any shortness of breath.  This heaviness has been in \nher chest on and off for the last six weeks.  She is quite concerned.\n\nShe has a history of hypothyroidism and hypertension.  She also has \nhyperlipidemia and is being treated with Lipitor.  Her health \nmaintenance has been in order.  She has just had a hysterectomy.  She \nneeds to have a follow-up mammogram done.  However, today I am most \nconcerned about her chest heaviness.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 130/80, respiratory rate is \n20 and pulse is 68.  Neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  \nChest is clear to both percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam is \nregularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen is soft and \nnontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are clear of \ncyanosis, clubbing and edema.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Her sodium is 145, electrolytes are all otherwise \nwithin normal limits.  TSH is 2.0.  LFTs are pending at this time.  We \nsent her for an electrocardiogram, which showed normal sinus rhythm with \nnonspecific ST-T wave changes.  We also sent her for an exercise \ntolerance test with preliminary reports showing that she went to a \nmaximum heart rate of 108, she was on the protocol for 6 minutes 50 \nseconds.  She had no evidence of ischemia.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1.\tChest heaviness.  I am not sure what is causing this.  She may have a \nprimary pulmonary problem.  She will be following up with us in one \nweek.  It is heartening to see that she does not have an abnormal \nexercise tolerance test.\n2.\tHypothyroidism, well controlled at the present time.

She has had couple of further episodes of this peculiar \nsensation in which her arm feels like it goes dead and then she \ngets some pressure in her chest.  She gets a slight shortness of \nbreath.  It lasts 30 seconds.  She gets as many as three or four \na day.  The frequency has, however, decreased and she is feeling \nbetter and better, as she begins to lose some weight.  I think \nweight loss is going to be critical.  She also is less fatigued \nas she begins to lose weight.\n\nHer hypertension has been under better control.  \nHydrochlorothiazide seems to be helping quite a bit in addition \nto the atenolol.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 146/86.  Weight has gone \nfrom 200 to 196 pounds.  Respiratory rate is 20.  Pulse is 64.  \nNeck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  Chest is clear to \npercussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam is regularly regular \nwith no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  \nThere is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are clear of \ncyanosis, clubbing and edema.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Electrolytes are within normal limits.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n1.\tHypertension.  Relatively well controlled on \nhydrochlorothiazide plus atenolol.\n2.\tWeight.  Now began to lose some weight and feeling much \nbetter as a result of it.\n3.\tPeculiar chest pressure.  I do not think she has coronary \nartery disease given the exercise test.  In light of this, \nwe will try to control her blood pressure and get her to \nlose some weight.  Hopefully, this will help with the \nresolution of her symptoms.\n\n\n\n_______________________________\nQuinn Rutledge, M.D.\n\nQR/RM5\n855930.do\nc\nDD:  \n06/27/2079\nDT:  \n06/28/2079\nDV:  \n06/23/2079\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As a result \nof this, I think it is reasonable for us in addition to having her on \natenolol to stop the hydrochlorothiazide, put her on ramipril and a \nnitrate.  She is having once every two weeks feeling a slight twinge of \npain that she was having before when she went up steps.\n\nShe did have hyperlipidemia.  We have put her on Lipitor, which has \nprovided some control.  However, her HCL is still 36 and LDL 118, which \nis not an excellent ratio.  Nonetheless, her CK has been within normal \nlimits.\n\nShe also has right shoulder lipoma.  This has become apparent since she \nlost so much weight.  She wanted to see someone in follow up and I have \nrecommended Dr. Dawson.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her weight is 170 pounds, blood pressure is \n120/64, respiratory rate is 20, and pulse is 64.  Neck is supple.  There \nis no lymphadenopathy.  Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.  \nCardiac exam is regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  \nAbdomen is soft and nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  \nExtremities are clear of cyanosis, clubbing, and edema.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  None today.\n\n\nRussell, Donna\n10418061\n08/11/79\nPage 2\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1.\tCAD.  We will start her on ramipril and long acting nitrate.  I also \ngave her nitroglycerine.  We will stop her hydrochlorothiazide but \ncontinue her atenolol.  She is also on one aspirin a day along with \nPremarin and Synthroid.\n2.\tWeight loss.  She will continue to exercise.  I suspect she is going \nto lose more weight.  This is excellent.\n3.\tCoronary artery disease.  Dr. Lu will be deciding when to do a \ncardiac catheterization.  It is his opinion, and I must concur that \nthis is an appropriate next step with Ms. Russell.  She is going to \ndelay her usual trip to Rhode Island until we can get final assessment \ndone on this variety of medical issues.\n\n\n\n_______________________________\nQuinn Rutledge, M.D.\n\nQR/RM5\n055626.doc\nDD:  \n08/16/2079\nDT:  08/18/2079\nDV:  08/11/2079\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Since I last saw him, he continues to complain of dyspnea.  An ETT was negative for ischemia.  PFTs were not really useful.  CT of the chest showed scarring/fibrosis.  His NT-proBNP has been on the marginal side, though he is without evidence for overt CHF.\n\n\n\nMedications:  Aspirin 325 mg qd, Flomax 0.4 mg qd, Lopressor 25 mg bid, Lipitor 10 mg qd, Lisinopril 20 mg qd, Colace 100 mg tid.\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:  Reveals him to be well appearing. His BP is 120/70 and his heart rate is 60 and regular. He is 170 pounds.  There is no jugular venous distention and carotid pulses are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.  His lungs are clear throughout, and notably demonstrate only very slight dullness at the left base.  His sternotomy is healing well and is stable.  His apical impulse is non-displaced with a slightly irregular rate and rhythm, a normal S1 and S2.  He has an S3 gallop.  No murmur.  His abdomen is benign without hepatosplenomegaly, bruits, or a dilated aorta.  There is no pedal edema and posterior tibial pulses are 2+ bilaterally.\n\n\n\nEKG:  NSR with a 1st degree AV block.

No chest discomfort.  No PND or orthopnea.\n\n\n\nMedications:  Aspirin 325 mg qd, Lipitor 10 mg qd, Diovan 160 mg qd\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:  Reveals him to be well appearing. His BP is 111/50 and his heart rate is 68 and regular. He is 176 pounds.  There is no jugular venous distention and carotid pulses are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.
