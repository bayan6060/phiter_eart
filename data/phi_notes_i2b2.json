About a week ago he slipped on\nthe driveway at home and sustained an injury to his left ankle. \nHe was seen at Tri-City Hospital and was told he had a\nfracture.  He was placed in an air splint and advised to be\npartial weight bearing, and he is using a cane.  He is here for\nroutine follow-up. \nPast medical history is notable for no ankle injuries previously. \nHe has a history of diabetes and sleep apnea.  He takes Prozac,\nCardizem, Glucophage and Amaryl.  He is also followed by Dr. Harold\nNutter for an arrhythmia.  He does not smoke.  He drinks\nminimally.  He is a set designer at Columbia Pictures.\n \nOn examination today he has slight tenderness of the left ankle\nabout four fingerbreadths above the malleolus.  The malleolus is\nnon-tender medially or laterally with no ligamentous tenderness\neither.  Dorsal flexion and plantar flexion is without pain. \nThere is no significant swelling.  There are no some skin changes\nwith some small abrasions proximally.  There is no fibular\ntenderness proximally.  No anterior pain is noted.  No hindfoot,\nmidfoot or forefoot tenderness is noted. \nI would like him to use a tube sock with his air cast.  He is\nusing a cane for ambulation.  His x-rays do not show a notable\nfracture pattern today, and we will await the Radiology opinion. \nI would like him to stay in the air splint with the sock.  I will\nsee him back in six weeks for review at the Boxborough office. \n \n \nDiagnosis:  Left ankle fracture.\n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________________________\nHabib Valenzuela, M.D.\n \nHV/kuntz\nMmedical\n \ncc:  Harlan Oneil, M.D.\n     \n     Harold Nutter, M.D.\n     Doctors Hospital North\n     64 Bruce St\n     Omak, GA 72196\n \nHabib Valenzuela, M.D.\n \nDD: 02/12/06\nDT: 02/17/06\nDV: 02/12/06\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\n\n\n\n",

The \n\npatient was seen by the Emergency Medicine resident.  I have \n\ndiscussed the management with the resident.  I have also seen the \n\npatient primarily and reviewed the medical record.  This is a brief \n\naddendum to the medical record.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Briefly, this is a 45-year-old \n\nmale who complains of several days of nausea, vomiting, and left \n\nlower quadrant discomfort.  He also describes intermittent chest \n\npain, which he has had for a number of months without significant \n\nchange.  He was sent in from his primary care doctor today with \n\nthis pain and was also noted to have some EKG changes.  The patient \n\nhas no chest pain at the time of evaluation in the emergency \n\ndepartment and no shortness of breath.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As indicated and otherwise negative.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As indicated in the chart.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As indicated in the chart.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient is very \n\nwell-appearing, a smiling, very pleasant gentleman in no acute \n\ndistress.  The blood pressure is 119/90, the pulse 82, and the \n\ntemperature 97.9 degrees.  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  The chest \n\nis clear to auscultation.  The heart has a regular rate and rhythm. \n\nThe abdomen is soft.  He has left lower quadrant tenderness.  He \n\nalso, of note on cardiovascular examination, has a soft murmur \n\nwhich he says he has had since childhood.  The extremities are \n\nnormal.  The neurologic examination is non-focal. \n\nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  This is a gentleman with abdominal \n\npain who will receive a CAT scan to rule out diverticulitis.  He \n\nhas also had some non-specific ST changes on his EKG.  He is \n\npain-free at this time.  He does not describe a classic exertional \n\npattern for his chest pain, but given that he is a diabetic and \n\nwith EKG changes, he will also be admitted for rule out MI.  A CT \n\nis pending at the time of this dictation.\n\nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  As above.  The \n\npatient's condition is currently stable. \n\n___________________________________                    CK498/89095 \n\nJAY CARROLL, M.D.  JC72                                 D:03/14/08 \n\n                                                       T:03/14/08 \n\nDictated by:  JAY CARROLL, M.D.  JC72 \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\nRecord date: 2109-09-14\n\n \nSeptember 14, 2109 \n \nVicente Blair, M.D.  \nInternal Medical \nDoctors Hospital North \nOmak, Georgia 72196 \n \nRE: VALDEZ, Harlan \nDHN#: 7672624 \nDATE OF BIRTH: 11/09/2062 \nCURRENT CLINIC VISIT DATE: 09/14/2109 \n \nDear Vicente, \n \nThank you in advance for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan B. Valdez, a 46-year-old male patient with prior polysomnographic evidence of sleep disordered breathing, as well as a history of difficulty in sleep, reinitiation and maintenance and increased early morning awakenings, as well as mixed systemic medical conditions.  \n \nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: As you already know, Mr. Valdez who demonstrates a history of difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance, as well as increased early morning awakenings, has noted an exacerbation of these sleep difficulties, occurring in temporal association with his loss of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year. He is now placed in the unfortunate situation of being a single parent to a 15-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter and describes a modification of his current employment duties of a set designer. In particular, Mr. Valdez describes undergoing on frequent international travelling which has bee markedly curtailed as he is tending to his family situation closer to home.  \n \nHe described a history of intermittent snoring symptomatology but is unaware of specific nocturnal respiratory pauses. He is unaware of a \"restless\" lower limb sensory complaints which may impact on his ability to initiate or reinitiate sleep. He denies a history of a \" night owl\" personality or circadian rhythm dysfunction which may have played a role with respect to nocturnal sleep disruptions or sleep difficulties.   \nHe denies a history of paroxysmal abnormal disturbances or associated narcoleptic symptoms.  \n \nMr. Valdez underwent an initial formal polysomnographic evaluation at the center for sleep diagnostics at Holy Cross on 11/26/05, during which time he was noted to demonstrate a respiratory disturbance index of 81/hour, particularly exacerbated in the supine position and characterized predominantly by hypopneas, with equal distribution during non-REM and stage REM sleep and with associated O2 desaturation Nadir of 88% The respiratory disturbances were predominantly obstructive or mixed hypopneas. In addition, loud snoring was noted.  \n \nThere was evidence of a sleep efficiency of 88% and a short sleep onset latency of 4 minutes. There was a predominance of \"light\" non-REM stages I-II sleep, and a concomitant inability to achieve significant \"slow-wave\" or stage REM sleep. There was also \"alpha intrusions and alpha delta sleep\" evident during the initial sleep study. In addition premature ventricular contractions were noted.  \n \nThe patient underwent a CPAP titration on 01/15/06, also at the Tenacre Foundation Nursing Home in Boxborough, during which time there was a marked reduction in the frequency of hypopneas (respiratory disturbance index equals 2/hour) with CPAP titrations between 4-6 cm. Sleep efficiency improved to 91%, a short sleep onset latency was also noted (3 minutes). There was once again an increased predominance of \"light\" non-REM stage I-II sleep, with concomitant inability to achieve sustained \"slow wave sleep\".  \n \nSince his initial trial of nocturnal CPAP titration (at 6 cm of water pressure) and with various CPAP mask modifications (including CPAP nasal face mask and a Mallinckrodt \"Breeze\" supportive head gear with \"nasal pillows\". The patient describes associated claustrophobic symptomatology, relative difficulties with sustained nocturnal home CPAP use, and difficulties with regards to CPAP to being and complications by the bulkiness of the CPAP machine in general. As a result, he has not utilized nocturnal CPAP therapy for a period of time, although he still maintains the CPAP equipment in his house.  \n \nOf particular note, and exacerbation of the past year, the patient demonstrates increased early morning awakenings (averaging 2-4 in number) with typical awakenings occurring approximately two hours after sleep initiation at 9:30 p.m. (the patient describes one awakening at 11:30 p.m. and the second awakening at 11:45 a.m., of unclear causative etiology). The patient then might awaken at 3 a.m. and be \"ready for the day\".  If he is able to reinitiate sleep thereafter, the patient may demonstrate additional two early morning awakenings after a final awakening at 6 a.m.  \n \nThe patient is noted to have a history of mixed systemic conditions including diabetes, coronary artery disease, depressive disorder, as well as a relatively stable gastrointestinal condition, with no upper GI evidence of gastroparesis.  \n \nMEDICATIONS:  \n1. Provigil 200 mg p.o. q. a.m. PRN.  \n2. Lithium.  \n3. Valproate.  \n4. Glucophage 850 mg t.i.d.  \n5. Humulin 15 units at night.  \n6. Folate.  \n7. Metoprolol.  \n8. Cardia.  \n9. Vitamin E.  \n10. Coated aspirin.  \n \nALLERGIES/ADVERSE REACTIONS: The patient describes an enhancement to suicidal tendencies in association with prior Prozac usage.   \nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies active tobacco or alcoholic beverage usage. He has lost 15-20 pounds over the past several years. His current weight is 195 pounds. He is desirous of losing some additional weight with regards to more regular exercise, but his hectic social situation makes this somewhat difficult at the present time.  \n \nOn examination, the patient demonstrates a blood pressure of 146/88, (seated, left arm), respiratory rate 16.  \n \nHEENT EXAMINATION: Borderline small posterior oropharyngeal aperture, with slightly increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a slightly elongated uvula noted.  \n \nThe patient appears awake, alert, with speech clear and fluent and receptive language function essentially intact. He is presently wearing dental braces. No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated. No focal, sensory, motor or neurologic deficits are noted. No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence. The routine gait appears to be normal based, without evidence of significant gait dystaxias.  No current clinical ictal manifestations are present. No acute evidence of \"micro-sleeps\" are noted.  \n \nIMPRESSION:  \n1. Sleep stage/arrousal dysfunction (780.56): Manifested by subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, increased daytime fatigue and alternating hypersomnia, and recurrent polysomnographic evidence of \"lightened\" sleep pattern, with increased predominance of non-REM stages 1-2 sleep, and with the presence of \"alpha\" intrusions and \"alpha delta\" component to deeper sleep. These latter EEG findings have been described in association with subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, as well as clinical setting of chronic pain related complaints, depressive or anxiety disorder or intercurrent psychotropics agents used (but more usually associated with benzodiazepine or barbituate usage).  \n2. Sleep disordered breathing: As evidenced during prior polysomnographic evaluations, mostly of obstructive and or mixed hypopnea. The patient appears largely refractory to a trial of CPAP therapy, particularly in so far as he demonstrates associated claustrophobic symptoms in association with it's usage, despite relatively modest CPAP water pressures (6 cm). In addition, he has tried various nasal CPAP face mask, including the Mallinckrodt \"Breeze\" supportive head gear with \"nasal pillows\" and with limited success. One might consider repeating a polysomnographic evaluation in the future, and if so, utilizing a potential trial of BIPAP titration, which may help to improve claustrophobic symptoms, but the patient will still be left with the issues referable to \"tangled tubing at night\" and issues referable to nasal face mask usage, as noted above.  3. Relative difficulties in sleep reinitiation and maintenance:  The patient describes at least 2-4 early morning awakenings with difficulty in sleep reinitiation and maintenance, thereby compounding his current sleep problem. While there would logically be a relationship between his current sleep exacerbations and the recent death of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year, there may also be evidence of other nocturnal sleep disturbances for which a repeat polysomnographic evaluation; i.e. in particular looking for the presence of increased spontaneous arousals or limb associated arousals or periodic limb movements of sleep may be of a special clinical benefit.  \n \nPLAN:  \n1. In the short course, in so far as the patient describes himself as being exceedingly tired, and unable to perform the routine daily tasks of work and managing a family in the absence of his deceased wife, I have suggested initiation of PRN Zolpidem tartrate therapy, 5 mg tablets, utilizing one to two tablets p.o.  q. h.s. PRN for difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance.  \n2. The patient is advised to take Zolpidem tartrate therapy no more than 2-3 times per week, in an effort to avoid any issues of physiologic dependency.  \n3. The patient was advised against potential adverse behavioral and or systemic side effects of Zolpidem tartrate therapy including  hypersomnolence, gastric upset, loose stools, diarrhea, and or cardiac palpitations.  \nPending his clinical response of his Zolpidem tartrate therapy, I then might seek direct treatment for his sleep disordered breathing issues which may include a repeat sleep study with potential trial of BIPAP therapy (in an effort to modify or attenuate claustrophobic symptoms). If he proves poorly responsive to trial of BIPAP therapy however, I might consider supplemental O2 therapy at night and, with this in mind a follow up sleep study should have associated end-tidal CO2 monitoring as well.  \n4. In the meantime, the patient was advised to contact the sleep disorders clinic for any acute sleep related concerns in the interim.  \n5. The patient may also benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches with regards to sleep reinitiation such as hypnotherapy, but I will hold off on these strategies pending follow up sleep disorders clinic evaluation (in approximately four months time).   \nOnce again, thank you again for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan Valdez. I hope this letter finds you well.  \n \nSincerely yours, \n \n \nYovani Vergara, M.D.  \nSleep Clinic \nDoctors Hospital North \n \n \ncc: Sleep Clinic DHN \n \nDD:09/14/2109 \nDT:09/15/2109 \nTX:24217     :1991 \n \n\n\n\n\n",

This CP was minimal, but the weakness made him pull over.  He had a repeat of these symptoms day of admission.  His EKG c/w 2/2107 showed flattened T-wave in V2 and TWI in V3 and flattened T-waves in I, aVL. His trop was negative, but MB index was elevated.  Due to T-wave flattening, history and elevated index it was decided to start on heparin and ASA and take to cath lab.  \n\n\n\nCath showed right dominant system with prox Cx 40%, LAD clear, RCA prox 70-80% lesion and ostial PDA 90%.  During final dye injection, pt had VF arrest and 2 shocks.  Pt regained puls and was in AF (new) with RVR. Pt was started on amio.  Pt then began to experience discomfort in the RVR and it was decided to intervene.  POBA was done to ostial PDA.  A first no-eluting stent was placed in prox RCA and pt had dissection and thus 2cd stent was placed.  On admission to CCU, pt still in AF with RVR (120's).  He was on amio drip, BB, loaded on plavix, ASA, lipitor, integrilin and was placed on Avandia study.  His complaint of some mild chest pain (not same as anginal pain day before) thought to be from defibrillation.\n\n\n\nPast Medical History: DMII, hyperchol, bipolar,HTN, depression (s/p ECT)\n\n \n\nMedications on admission: ASA, Lipitor 20, lopressor 50 bid, folate, norvasc 5 qd; lithium, 300 bid; depakote 500 bid; sonata 10 mg qhs, doxylamine 25 qhs, mirtazapine 45 qd \n\n\n\nMeds on Transfer: please see green sheets\n\n \n\nMedications: ASA, Lipitor 20, lopressor 50 bid, folate, norvasc 5 qd; lithium, 300 bid; depakote 500 bid; sonata 10 mg qhs, doxylamine 25 qhs, mirtazapine 45 qd \n\n\n\nAllergies:  NKDA\n\n\n\nFamily History:  family h/o CAD\n\n\n\nSocial History: No EtOH, no tob, no illicits\n\n\n\nReview of Systems:  per HPI\n\n\n\nAllergies:  NKDA\n\n\n\nFamily History:  family h/o CAD\n\n\n\nSocial History: No EtOH, no tob, no illicits\n\n\n\nReview of Systems:  per HPI\n\n\n\nCCU course + plan:\n\n1)\tCards\n\na.\tRhythm - on night of admission patient was started on an esmolol drip as well as amio bloused and rhythm converted to NSR.

Will look for LAE, holter abnl.  Could make a case to anti-coagulate regardless as has had documented afib.  \n\nCV: hold anti-htn meds now.  Continue lipitor at outpt dose.  Allow SBP up to 180.\n\nPSYCH: continue w/ depakote and lithium.

She has been in Rhode Island for \nsix months.  Her complaint is that she has heaviness in the chest.  She \ndoes not have any palpitations.  She does not note that this is \nassociated with exertion.  She does have diaphoresis associated with it.  \nShe does not have any shortness of breath.  This heaviness has been in \nher chest on and off for the last six weeks.  She is quite concerned.\n\nShe has a history of hypothyroidism and hypertension.  She also has \nhyperlipidemia and is being treated with Lipitor.  Her health \nmaintenance has been in order.  She has just had a hysterectomy.  She \nneeds to have a follow-up mammogram done.  However, today I am most \nconcerned about her chest heaviness.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 130/80, respiratory rate is \n20 and pulse is 68.  Neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  \nChest is clear to both percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam is \nregularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen is soft and \nnontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are clear of \ncyanosis, clubbing and edema.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Her sodium is 145, electrolytes are all otherwise \nwithin normal limits.  TSH is 2.0.  LFTs are pending at this time.  We \nsent her for an electrocardiogram, which showed normal sinus rhythm with \nnonspecific ST-T wave changes.  We also sent her for an exercise \ntolerance test with preliminary reports showing that she went to a \nmaximum heart rate of 108, she was on the protocol for 6 minutes 50 \nseconds.  She had no evidence of ischemia.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1.\tChest heaviness.  I am not sure what is causing this.  She may have a \nprimary pulmonary problem.  She will be following up with us in one \nweek.  It is heartening to see that she does not have an abnormal \nexercise tolerance test.\n2.\tHypothyroidism, well controlled at the present time.

She has had couple of further episodes of this peculiar \nsensation in which her arm feels like it goes dead and then she \ngets some pressure in her chest.  She gets a slight shortness of \nbreath.  It lasts 30 seconds.  She gets as many as three or four \na day.  The frequency has, however, decreased and she is feeling \nbetter and better, as she begins to lose some weight.  I think \nweight loss is going to be critical.  She also is less fatigued \nas she begins to lose weight.\n\nHer hypertension has been under better control.  \nHydrochlorothiazide seems to be helping quite a bit in addition \nto the atenolol.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 146/86.  Weight has gone \nfrom 200 to 196 pounds.  Respiratory rate is 20.  Pulse is 64.  \nNeck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  Chest is clear to \npercussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam is regularly regular \nwith no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  \nThere is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are clear of \ncyanosis, clubbing and edema.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Electrolytes are within normal limits.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n1.\tHypertension.  Relatively well controlled on \nhydrochlorothiazide plus atenolol.\n2.\tWeight.  Now began to lose some weight and feeling much \nbetter as a result of it.\n3.\tPeculiar chest pressure.  I do not think she has coronary \nartery disease given the exercise test.  In light of this, \nwe will try to control her blood pressure and get her to \nlose some weight.  Hopefully, this will help with the \nresolution of her symptoms.\n\n\n\n_______________________________\nQuinn Rutledge, M.D.\n\nQR/RM5\n855930.do\nc\nDD:  \n06/27/2079\nDT:  \n06/28/2079\nDV:  \n06/23/2079\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As a result \nof this, I think it is reasonable for us in addition to having her on \natenolol to stop the hydrochlorothiazide, put her on ramipril and a \nnitrate.  She is having once every two weeks feeling a slight twinge of \npain that she was having before when she went up steps.\n\nShe did have hyperlipidemia.  We have put her on Lipitor, which has \nprovided some control.  However, her HCL is still 36 and LDL 118, which \nis not an excellent ratio.  Nonetheless, her CK has been within normal \nlimits.\n\nShe also has right shoulder lipoma.  This has become apparent since she \nlost so much weight.  She wanted to see someone in follow up and I have \nrecommended Dr. Dawson.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her weight is 170 pounds, blood pressure is \n120/64, respiratory rate is 20, and pulse is 64.  Neck is supple.  There \nis no lymphadenopathy.  Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.  \nCardiac exam is regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  \nAbdomen is soft and nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  \nExtremities are clear of cyanosis, clubbing, and edema.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  None today.\n\n\nRussell, Donna\n10418061\n08/11/79\nPage 2\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1.\tCAD.  We will start her on ramipril and long acting nitrate.  I also \ngave her nitroglycerine.  We will stop her hydrochlorothiazide but \ncontinue her atenolol.  She is also on one aspirin a day along with \nPremarin and Synthroid.\n2.\tWeight loss.  She will continue to exercise.  I suspect she is going \nto lose more weight.  This is excellent.\n3.\tCoronary artery disease.  Dr. Lu will be deciding when to do a \ncardiac catheterization.  It is his opinion, and I must concur that \nthis is an appropriate next step with Ms. Russell.  She is going to \ndelay her usual trip to Rhode Island until we can get final assessment \ndone on this variety of medical issues.\n\n\n\n_______________________________\nQuinn Rutledge, M.D.\n\nQR/RM5\n055626.doc\nDD:  \n08/16/2079\nDT:  08/18/2079\nDV:  08/11/2079\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Since I last saw him, he continues to complain of dyspnea.  An ETT was negative for ischemia.  PFTs were not really useful.  CT of the chest showed scarring/fibrosis.  His NT-proBNP has been on the marginal side, though he is without evidence for overt CHF.\n\n\n\nMedications:  Aspirin 325 mg qd, Flomax 0.4 mg qd, Lopressor 25 mg bid, Lipitor 10 mg qd, Lisinopril 20 mg qd, Colace 100 mg tid.\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:  Reveals him to be well appearing. His BP is 120/70 and his heart rate is 60 and regular. He is 170 pounds.  There is no jugular venous distention and carotid pulses are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.  His lungs are clear throughout, and notably demonstrate only very slight dullness at the left base.  His sternotomy is healing well and is stable.  His apical impulse is non-displaced with a slightly irregular rate and rhythm, a normal S1 and S2.  He has an S3 gallop.  No murmur.  His abdomen is benign without hepatosplenomegaly, bruits, or a dilated aorta.  There is no pedal edema and posterior tibial pulses are 2+ bilaterally.\n\n\n\nEKG:  NSR with a 1st degree AV block.

No chest discomfort.  No PND or orthopnea.\n\n\n\nMedications:  Aspirin 325 mg qd, Lipitor 10 mg qd, Diovan 160 mg qd\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:  Reveals him to be well appearing. His BP is 111/50 and his heart rate is 68 and regular. He is 176 pounds.  There is no jugular venous distention and carotid pulses are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.

        "text": "\n\n\nRecord date: 2145-08-13\n\nAugust 12, 2145 \n\n \n\n \n\nDr. Mabel Duvall \n\nMedicine Department \n\nBellflower Doctors Hospital \n\n \n\n \n\nRE:  TUTTLE, Sandy \n\nMR#:  2793372 \n\nDOB:  January 16, 2082 \n\n \n\n \n\nDear Dr. Duvall:  \n\n \n\nThank you for referring Mr. Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department.  I understand that he is referred here for evaluation of polyneuropathy.  \n\n \n\nMr. Tuttle is a 63-year-old right-handed diabetic man who has developed numbness of his lower extremities since 2125.  The numbness started in his toes and gradually spread proximally up to the level of the knees.  In 2135, the numbness started to affect his hands.  In 2139, the patient noted atrophy of the first dorsal interosseous muscles of both hands, left worse than right.  \n\n \n\nThe patient denies any pain in his legs or feet.  He has a five year history of localized low back pain and neck pain radiating to his left upper extremity all the way down to his hands.  In 2125, the patient fell down a ladder from a height of about 30 feet.  According to the patient, he herniated a cervical disk, but surgery was not indicated.  He remembers having pain in his left elbow and neck after the fall.  \n\n \n\nThe patient developed impotence and constipation in 2130.  In 2139, he started to have symptoms of orthostatic hypotension which he described as feeling light-headed, darkening of vision upon standing.  The patient also noted gait imbalance in 2139 prior to his retirement in 2141.  \n\n \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin dependent diabetes since 2123, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, constipation, impotence, macular degeneration of the eyes, retinopathy, s/p laser treatments, history of neck pain and low back pain as mentioned above, history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, skin problems using a number of steroid creams, penile implant in 2130.  \n\n \n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol, Diltiazem, Zestril, Mevacor, steroid creams, Colace, metoclopramide, Naprosyn, insulin.   \n\n\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  \n\n \n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married he has two daughters, 30 and 40 years of age.  He used to work as a Legal Secretary until he retired in December of 2141.  The patient quit smoking in 2107.  He denies any history of alcohol or drug abuse.  \n\n \n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of unclear cause at the age of 45.  His father was diabetic and had heart problems.  Mother died in her 30's.  The patient does not know the cause of death.  The patient had one brother who died in his 50's from diabetic complications.  He had two sister who died of diabetic complications.  Of his two living sisters, one of them is also a diabetic.  The patient's daughters are not diabetic.  There is no known family history of neuromuscular disorders.  \n\n \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Range of motion of the neck is limited.  Head turning 45 degrees to either side.  Limited neck extension.  Negative straight-leg raising.  Negative spine tenderness.  Regular cardiac rhythm, no heart murmur.  Negative carotid bruits.  In the supine position, blood pressure 105/50, heart rate 60 and regular.  Upon standing, blood pressure dropped to 60/40, heart rate remained 60.  The patient was asymptomatic.   \n\n\n\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:  Mental status:  Alert, coherent and appropriate.  The patient knows the name of his physician, Dr. Duvall, Dr. Villagomez, and Dr. Goldberg at Pioneer Home.  \n\n \n\nCranial nerves:  Visual fields full.  Visual acuity with reading glasses 20/30 on the right, 20/20 -1 on the left.  Extraocular movements full.  No nystagmus.  Pupils sluggishly reactive to light.  Optic discs flat bilaterally.  No facial asymmetry.  The tongue and soft palate move symmetrically.  \n\n \n\nMotor examination:  Atrophy of the first dorsal interosseous and ADM, worse on the left hand.  No atrophy of the abductor pollicis brevis.  Negative arm drift.  Motor strength testing 5/5 in all muscles of both upper extremities except for 4/5 weakness of the first dorsal interosseous and abductor digiti minimi bilaterally.  No weakness of the abductor pollicis brevis on either hand.  Motor strength testing of the lower extremities 5/5 except for mild weakness of toe extensors 4+/5 bilaterally.  The patient was able to walk on his toes and heels while holding onto the examiner.  Deep tendon reflexes 2+ bilaterally at the biceps, triceps, and knees.  Absent ankle jerks bilaterally.  Toes downgoing.  No spasticity of the lower extremities.\n\n   \n\nSensory examination:  Significant for absent pin prick sensation in both feet up to the level of the knees.  Pin prick sensation is diminished in the dorsal aspect of all fingers and the palmar aspect of both hands.  Vibratory sensation absent in the toes, intact at the ankles and knees bilaterally.  Intact vibratory sensation in the upper extremities.  Romberg test significant for body swaying, but the patient did not fall.  Tandem gait was poor, but improved when holding the examiner.  No limb ataxia.   \n\n\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Review of previous laboratory tests of May, 2145, BUN 36, creatinine 1.7, glucose 310.  December, 2144, TSH normal.  October, 2143, B12 normal.  Negative RPR.  The patient said he was tested negative for HIV in 2142, and 2143.  MRI of the brain in 2142 and 2143 revealed bilateral white matter changes in the cerebral hemisphere without any intracranial mass lesion.   \n\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  In summary, we have a 63-year-old diabetic man who appears to have significant sensorimotor polyneuropathy with autonomic involvement.  He does have constipation and impotence as well as orthostatic hypotension.  \n\n\n\nAs we discussed on the phone, his antihypertensive medications need to be adjusted and the patient will be following up with you regarding this.  He may benefit from Jobst stockings to reduce his symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.  I will be ordering an EMG to assess his polyneuropathy and look for any evidence of superimposed ulnar neuropathy or cervical radiculopathy on the left.  The EMG should also include RR interval variations and sympathetic skin responses.  \n\n \n\nMRI of the cervical spine was also ordered to rule out any cord compression which may also contribute to loss of sensation in the legs.  The patient does have a history of traumatic cervical herniated disk in 2125.  He may also have had a left elbow injury at this time which can make him prone to develop tardy ulnar palsy.  \n\n \n\nThe patient will return for a follow-up visit after the above tests.  \n\n \n\nThank you again for referring Mr. Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department.  \n\n \n\nSincerely, \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStanly Lang, M.D.  \n\n \n\n \n\ncc: Dr. T.

He has had LBP for at least three years which is located in his mid lumbar region, non radiating, worse with standing.  The pain had progressed such that he has a very poor performance status. He cannot stand but for a few minutes at a time.  He denies focal wekness.   He had an MRI of the LS spine 2/02/47 which revealed heterogeneous marrow concernig for an infiltrating process in his marrow.   He has had an SPEP which was normal, he has had a bone scan which was negatvie. He does not have an elevated protein or globulin fraction. His CRI is longstanding  and attributed to his DM.  He was set up for a outpt BM bx to evaluate the marrow process, but the pain has been so severe, he was admitted for an inpatient work up.  Of note he has longstanding anemia related to his CRI, perhaps anemia of chronic disease.  He denies any weight loss, fevers, chills, night sweats, decreased appetite. He does report fatigue which has become progressive.\n\n\n\nPMH:\n\n1. DM\n\n2. autonomic dysfunction with orthostatic hypotension\n\n3. diabetic retinopathy\n\n4. depression\n\n5. CRI\n\n6. OA\n\n7.  H/o TB 2132 \n\n8.  C7 radiculopthy with bil hand weakness and neck pain\n\n9. HL\n\n10 Seborrheic dermatitis\n\n\n\nMeds:\n\nlovastatin, fludrocortisone, celexa, reglan, proamatine, ultram, insulin, colace, ecasa\n\n\n\nAll: NKDA\n\n\n\nFH: Father had Diabetes, mother died of breast cancer.\n\n\n\nSH: Worked in Foxworthy Industrials 2100-4 during which time he had multple exposures to chemicals. Retired from working in the city of Victorville 2141. He reports a 30 pyr hx of tobacco, former hx of heavy ETOH use, stopped since 12/46. Denies IV DU.\n\n\n\nPE:\n\nGeneral: thin gentleman, in no actute distress\n\nHEENT: PERRLA< EOMI, Op without thrush, no thyromegaly, No JVD\n\nChest: CTA bil\n\nCV: RRR nml s1, s2, no m/g/r\n\nAbd: + bs, soft, non-tender, non-distended, no hepatosplenomegaly\n\nExt: no c/c/e\n\nneuro: strenth 5/5 throughout; absent patellar reflexes, 2+ biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, downgoing toes bilaterally\n\n\n\nLabs:\n\nCr 1.4  Bun 25  HCT 28.6  WBC 5.5  Plt 201  MCV 87  80seg; 15l\n\nESR 35\n\nPt/Ptt nml\n\nSPEP 2/47: nml  T prot 6  Alb 3.4\n\nMRI 1/47: heterogenous bonemarrow uptake in vertebrae and pelvis, concerning for infiltrative process\n\n\n\nImp/Plan:\n\nMr. Tuttle is a 65 year old male with a three year hisotry of porgressive lower back pain, non-radicualr in nature. The pain has progressed to a significant level such that he spends most of his day in bed.  He did have an MRI of the L/S spine which was negative except it did reveal heterogeous uptake in the vertebral and pelvic bone marrow. They raised the question of multiple myeloma or another infiltrative process. He does have renal insufficiency, but no other abnormalities to suggest MM. We still need a few key pieces of data to rule this out. Other infiltrative processes such as malignancy from elsewhere should be excluded.  In addition, he has a hx of a positive PPD, unclear if he actually had active TB or was treated prophylactically. Is any of this TB?  Recommend:\n\n-- skeletal survey\n\n-- quantitative urine bence jones proteins as there are  non-secretory myelomas\n\n-- beta-2 microglobulin\n\n-- reticulocyte count\n\n-- consider chest CT to r/o lung cancer given his history of tobacco\n\n-- guaiac all stools\n\n-- Will review the MRI with radiologist to get a better differential\n\n-- Consider BM biopsy next week, unfortunately will not be able to perform today. \n\n-- Will review smear and staff with Dr. Landry in the afternoon.\n\nThank you for this consult.\n\n\n\n______________________________________________\n\n\n\nIvy Whitaker, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Monitoring of Ultracet therapy and left shoulder injection.  \n\n \n\nINTERVAL HISTORY:  Left shoulder injection was helpful but only last short time.  Just  a week or so.  Ultracet was relieving pains but was not able to afford it.  Feels stable and not worse since last seen.  Telling me he is cutting down his medications and he is letting his doctors know about this. No acute swelling or further different joint complaints other than what was described in my previous notes.  Rest of review of systems again unchanged.   \n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  The medication file is same as last time, except for addition of Tylenols now.  \n\n \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: BP 100/70.  Other VS WNL. Wt. 170lb.  Gait:  Slow.  Cooperative.  VSS.  HEENT:  Halitosis.  Poor teeth hygiene.  Lungs:  Clear.  Heart:  Unremarkable.  Abdomen exam:  Slight sensitiveness in epigastrium.  A little low-frequency tremor in extremities.  Musculoskeletal examination:  Both shoulders with limited ROM.  Left shoulder active ROM is improved compared to the last description.  Hands with prayer's sign present.  Elbows again show lesser degree of flexion contracture.  Range of motion in both shoulders diminished, \n\nmore in the left side.  Hardening of skin on the palm side of hands.  Has atrophy of intrinsic muscles of hands.  The rest of joint examination, free of inflammation.  Unchanged from last description.  \n\n \n\nIMPRESSION:  Diabetic cheiropathy.  Rule out other diabetes-related musculoskeletal syndrome esp in shoulders.  Helped by Ultracet.  Osteoarthritis changes of early stage.  Status post olecranon bursitis.  Elevated creatinine.  \n\n \n\nPLANS:  \n\n1.  Continue Ultracet up 2 tablets prn once     twice a day; Samples given.\n\n2.  May consider low-dose narcotics, given his multiple comorbidity and sensitive renal function to nonsteroidal therapy.  3.  Close followup for diabetes care with other physicians.   \n\nDISPOSITION:  Followup in 4 months or so.  \n\n \n\n \n\n_______________________________ \n\nVirgil Gregory, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

His last echo was done in 4/48 showed an EF of 59% presented to the health clinic with a 3 day hx of worsening L shoulder pain and episodes of diaphoresis. The shoulder pain is chronic and thought to be due to oa, and dm chor.He came to the clinic today for a BP check ( he is often hypotensive and orthostatic) and was noted to have TWI inferiorly and laterally on routine EKG.   He denied any chest pain, nausea, vomiting when he went to the e.r. \n\nIn the e.r., his first set of cardiac enzymes was negative, he was also started on heparin IV, and given IV lopressor, and an aspirin. Of note, the patient had a bp up to 182/88. When the patient arrived on the floor he denied any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis.

He awoke 3/18 AM with sl fatigue, FS 190. He went to his preop cataract appt at FCH and c/o diaphoresis. His FS was 43, BP 122/50, HR 90. EKG revealed STD V2-V3 + pseudonorm T V4-V6-> left with baseline TWI V3-V6. His CK and troponin were positive. He was treated with ASA, BB, ACE, and heparin. He has been sx free since FCH.\n\n\n\nProblem List (reviewed)\n\n\n\nTuberculosis MAJOR \n\nDiabetes mellitus MAJOR \n\nRadiculopathy MAJOR \n\nHypercholesterolemia MAJOR \n\nCoronary artery disease MAJOR \n\nOrthostatic hypotension MAJOR \n\nShoulder pain MAJOR \n\nDiabetic retinopathy MAJOR \n\nArthritis MAJOR \n\nDepression MAJOR \n\nRenal insufficiency MAJOR \n\nFatigue MAJOR \n\nLow back pain MAJOR \n\nShortness of breath MAJOR \n\nSeborrheic dermatitis \n\nTinea pedis \n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease \n\nSmoking status: former smoker \n\nConstipation \n\nHealth maintenance \n\n\n\nMajor Problems\n\nCoronary artery disease\n\nHistory of CAD w/ positive ETT 3/37 (nothing on PCIS); since then had neg adeno-MIBI in 2145, 2147, 8/48 (but only 9680 PDP).

Be VERY CAUTIOUS in use of BB, ACE with orthostatic hypotension (he has supine HTN but is extremely orthostatic when he stands up).\n\n- cards consult appreciated\n\n- bedrest x 24h\n\n- increase BB; hold ACE with pending cath.\n\n- pls repeat TTE as per cards\n\n- fasting chol pending; inc lipitor to 80 qd.\n\n\n\n2. BP: orthostatic hypotension/supine hypertension\n\n- d/c midodrine, florinef\n\n- BP control with BB (he will NOT be able to go home on this), IV TNG + nitropaste as needed.\n\n\n\n3. CRI: DM + chronic prerenal. Continue hydration with IVF o/n.\n\n- mucomyst, hold ACE.\n\n\n\n4. DM: on  Insulin 75/25, 28 qA, 26qP. Continue QID FS, adjust as needed. Pls resend HbA1c and get a nutrition consult. I am concerned that he is on too much regular insulin causing his nightsweats and his low glc at FCH yesterday. He may need to change back to NPH and regular (was difficult in the past 2/2 poor vision and arthritis).\n\n\n\n5. constipation: pls increase bowel regimen (currently on miralax + colace).\n\n\n\n6. PT consult please. He will likely need rehab.\n\n\n\nThanks for the excellent care!

Please see her current medication list.  She also has a history of diabetes.  \n\n\n\nOver the past few weeks to one month she has been having intermittent right shoulder pain.  It is worse with lifting.  The pain is in her deltoid muscle and radiates a little bit across her upper back.  It is worse if she actually lies on her shoulder at night.  There is no history of trauma, no neck pain, no upper extremity numbness or weakness except for occasional left thumb numbness.  The thumb numbness resolves if she shakes her hand.\n\n\n\nShe is also having bilateral knee pain when she walks.  There is no swelling or effusion or heat in her knees.  She had been on Vioxx for her spinal stenosis but stopped it because it was not helping her spinal stenosis pain.  Instead for her shoulder pain she has been taking Advil 200 mg 2 and up to 6 per day. She takes the Advil with food or milk and is not having any GI upset from it.  \n\n\n\nShe is having a lot of stresses with her husband, whom she feels may have some early memory problems.  His mini-mental status on his last exam was a 30/40.  However, he makes, according to her, arbitrary decisions, does not complete projects he starts, and not as task-oriented as he used to be.  He does not complete tasks or shopping errands that she would like him to do.  We discussed that he should make a follow-up appointment to see me to repeat his mini-mental status exam, but that some of these problems are not likely to be easily resolvable, and that she might benefit from finding ways to manage her anxiety and stress level.  She does get very anxious and upset at times.  She had been considering taking Ativan p.r.n. when she gets very upset and frustrated.  She is also having stressors with her grandson, who lives next door and has a problem with substance abuse and questionable money issues.  \n\n\n\nShe denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or edema.  She is on her diabetes medication.  She likes going to work because that gets her out of the house.\n\n\n\nON EXAMINATION:  She is a pleasant, animated woman in no acute distress.  Her blood pressure initially was 160/80.  After discussing her situation with her husband, her blood pressure was 180/85.  Neck supple without JVD or bruits.  Lungs are clear without rales or rhonchi.  Cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm and normal S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs.  She has no peripheral edema.\n\n \n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \n\n\n\n(1)\tHypertension, poor control.  Will increase her Zestril to 40 mg p.o. q.d.  Her daughter, Iyanna Field who is a registered nurse, will continue to monitor her blood pressure.  \n\n(2)\tRight shoulder pain.  On exam she has good range of motion of her shoulder and her muscle strength and reflexes are intact.  She can continue the Advil p.r.n. but should take it with antacids or something to protect her stomach.  \n\n\n\n(3)\tAdult-onset diabetes.  We will check her Hemoglobin A1c.  \n\n\n\nShe will follow up for her complete physical in May.  \n\n\n\n\n\nIda Xayachack, M.D.\n\n\n\nIX/delarosa/austin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\nRecord date: 2085-05-11\n\n\n\n\nNAME:    Justus, Quiana\nMRN:       9814048\n\nQuiana is a 73-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes and spinal stenosis who\ncomes in for a physical.  She has spinal stenosis as documented by her prior MRI's. \nShe can usually walk about 5 minutes and then develops pain in her thighs and\ncalves.  She has some knee pain with walking, but it is not consistent and does not\noccur after short 5-minute distances.  The thigh and calf pain resolve with rest.  She\ndoes not always have back pain with the thigh and calf pain.  She also has occasional\nright lateral foot pain that feels like an achy arthritic pain in her foot.  She takes\nVioxx occasionally for that foot pain.  She does not have any dysesthesias or\nnumbness in her feet or hands.  She has no recent trauma, fevers or chills.  She has\nno change in her bowel or bladder.\n\nShe has type 2 diabetes.  She has been taking Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.  Her weight is\nstable.  She does get annual ophthalmology evaluations.  \n\nShe has a history of hypertension. She has not had any chest pain, PND, orthopnea,\ndyspnea on exertion or edema.  Her blood pressure is never well controlled when she\ncomes for her visits here, but her daughter, Iyanna Field, a nurse takes her\nblood pressure at home and she reports that it is typically 120/70.  She is currently on\nPropranolol LA 160 2 tabs p.o. q.d., Dyazide 1 tab p.o. q.d., Captopril 50 mg t.i.d.\n\nShe has a history of hyperlipidemia.  She was intolerant of Lipitor in the past.  She\nhas been taking the Lopid 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. without complications.  She does not do\nregular breast self-exams but has not noted any masses.  She is status-post\nmenopause.  We discussed DEXA bone density scanning, but she did not want to do\nit at this time.\n\nWe also discussed colon cancer screening.  For now she elects to do stool guaiacs x 3. \nShe has not had any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena or hematochezia, abdominal\npain or weight loss.    \n\nPlease see her complete medication update in the LMR. \n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She is married.  She drinks occasional but not excessive alcohol. \nShe does not smoke.  There is no history of domestic abuse.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Please see family history update in the LMR.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative.\n\nShe has not had a recent tetanus shot.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: She is a very pleasant woman in no acute distress. Her blood\npressure here is 150/90.  Her neck is supple without JVD or bruits.  Lungs are clear\nwithout wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  Her breasts are without masses or adenopathy. \nHer cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2 without S3, S4 or\nmurmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.  She is\nmoderately obese.  Her rectal exam is without masses.  She has no spinal tenderness\non palpation.  Her lower extremity strength is 5/5.  She does not have any peripheral\nedema.  Her distal pulses are 2+.  Her sensation is intact to light touch in her feet.  \n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \n\n(1)  Back pain with calf and thigh pain with walking.  This is probably due to her\n     spinal stenosis.  However, she is at risk for claudication given her diabetes,\n     hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  We will check lower extremity noninvasive\n     arterial studies to rule out claudication.  She can take the Vioxx p.r.n. for her\n     foot pain which I do not think is related.\n\n(2)  Type 2 diabetes.  She needs a hemoglobin A1c.  Her blood pressure ideally\n     should be under 130/85.  She reports that it is consistently below that level\n     when her daughter checks it.  She needs as chem-7.  She has no evidence for\n     neuropathy at this time.\n\n(3)  Health maintenance.  She needs a tetanus shot which she was given today. \n     Will check stool guaiacs x 3.  \n\nWe discussed calcium supplementation for osteoporosis prevention.  She will follow\nup in six months and p.r.n.  She has not had a recent tetanus shot. She was given a\ntetanus shot in the left deltoid without complications.\n\n\nIda Xayachack, M.D.\n\nIX/delarosa/bishop\n\n\n\n\n",

She has a\n\nhistory of type 2 diabetes. Her sugars have not been optimally controlled. They are\n\nusually in the 190-200 range in the morning. Her weight is stable. She has no lower\n\nextremity numbness or weakness.  \n\n\n\nShe has a history of hyperlipidemia. She stopped her Lescol 2 weeks ago because it\n\nwas expensive. She also never increased the dose above 20 mg. She has had side\n\neffects with atorvastatin and pravastatin in the past. Please see her allergy list in\n\nLMR.\n\n\n\nShe has a half sister who had colon cancer at age 88. Quiana has had rare\n\noccasional blood streaking when she wipes herself after being constipated. She is\n\naware of what a colonoscopy is but absolutely refuses a colonoscopy. She is aware\n\nthat she is at increased risk for colon cancer given her family history. She has no\n\nnausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena or weight loss.\n\n\n\nShe has chronic lower back pain and bilateral leg pain that is probably due to spinal\n\nstenosis. She has lower back pain and pain in her legs that is worse with walking. It\n\nhelps when she uses a carriage to walk around in the store. She denies lower\n\nextremity numbness, change in her bowel or bladder, fevers or chills. Her last MRI\n\nwas done in Walsenburg in a wide body machine and was consistent with spinal stenosis. \n\nShe has taken Ultram. She is aware that Vioxx may increase people's risk for cardiac\n\ndisease and has stopped taking it. Dr. Yeager, her rheumatologist, referred her to Dr.\n\nNorth in Internal Medicine for possible injections. \n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: No acute distress. Her blood pressure is 180/90. However, her\n\ndaughter,Iyanna Field, checks her blood pressure at home and it is very well controlled. \n\nThe patient gets very anxious here in the clinic. Neck supple without JVD or bruits.\n\nLungs clear without wheezes, rales or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular,\n\nnormal S1, S2 without S3, S4 or murmurs. No C/C/E. Distal pulses intact.\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \n\n\n\n(1)  Type 2 diabetes. Check hemoglobin A1c. Continue current medications.\n\n\n\n(2)  Hyperlipidemia. She should be on medication to keep her LDL below 100. She\n\n     said that she would resume the medication.\n\n\n\n(3)  Hypertension which is never well controlled on her visits here. Her daughter is\n\n     a nursing professional and does report that her blood pressure is very well controlled\n\n     in the 120/80 range when she checks at home. We will continue her current\n\n     regimen.\n\n\n\n(4)  Lower back pain. Probably secondary to spinal stenosis. She has an\n\n     appointment with Dr. North.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIda Xayachack, M.D.\n\n\n\nIX/delarosa/bishop\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It began last Sunday, when she noticed the new onset of back pain, which progressed and was associated with shortness of breath by Monday. She apparently called EMS on Tuesday then and en route she had a long run of VT, which responded to 50mg of Lidocaine IV. She was intubated on arrival in the ED for progressive respiratory distress. ECG showed lateral ST elevations and a CT scan of her chest was negative for any signs of aortic dissection. Of note, she was also noticed to have elevated blood sugars in the 500s in the ED with an AG of 20, that came down to 16. \n\n\nOn immediate LHC, a 100% occlusion of her OM1 was found and recannalized as well as stented with a Vision BMS, resulting in TIMI 2 flow. Her LAD was found to be patent but and her RCA showed diffuse atherosclerosis up to 60% stenosis at most. LV ventriculogram showed inferior hypokinesis with moderate MR.  An IABP was placed with her initial augmented diastolic pressures recorded in the 80s, which led to the initiation of Levophed, Dobutamine and Dopamine.\n\n\nA PAC was placed in the cath lab as well with her initial Wedge reported as 19-20,  PAPs in the 50s.\n\n\nOn transfer to the CCU, she was intubated, sedated, being on IV Levophed at 20/hr, Dobutamine at 200/hr and Dopamine at 300/hr. Her CO was recorded as 6.0, her CI 3.5 with an initial SVR of 1012. Her Temp. was 96.1, HR 115 bpm, augmented diastolic BP of 124, which subsequently ranged between 70 and 100 on the day of her admission. She spiked a temperature up to 101 on the evening of admission after she received a dose of Levaquin IV in the setting of a rising WBC up to 40K. Vasopressin was added IV, which provided further support of her MAP. Intermittent NS fluid boluses helped to bring her HR down per RN and supported her MAPs with her PAD ranging between 18-24 and a urine output between 30 and 100 cc/hr. When her CI dropped to 1.9 around 9.30 pm with an increased SVR of 1550, the cardiac fellow was called and the decision was made to wean her Levophed as tolerated, which was then brought down to 16/hr with her Dopamine having been weaned off and continued Dobutamine and Vasopressin. The patient was also maintained on Reopro and Heparin IV for her STEMI.\n\n\nPMHx:\nHypertension\nDM type 2\nHyperlipidemia\nIron deficiency anemia with pt refusing colonoscopy for several months\nDJD of hands - involving PIP's, DIP's, 1st CMC's.  \nSpinal Stenosis L3-4\nBilateral carpal tunnel syndrome - s/p bilateral releases in spring 2090.\nCataracts\nHyperparathyroidism\nThyroid nodule - benign, biopsied 2089.\n\n\nAllergies:          \nAtorvastatin - myalgias\nPravastatin &#8211; myalgias\n\n\nMedications prior to Admission:\nAtenolol 100 MG PO QD\nAtivan 0.5 MG PO TID\nASA 81 MG PO QD \nColace 100 MG PO qd \nGlyburide 5MG PO BID\nIbuprofen 800 MG PO TID\nK-dur 10 MEQ PO QD\nLasix 20 MG PO qd\nLescol 20 MG PO QHS\nLisinopril 40 MG PO QD\nMetformin 1000 MG PO BID\nNorvasc 10MG PO QD\nUltram 50 MG PO BID\n\n\nSH:  Lives in Racine.

This could be edema or pneumonia. No large pleural effusions or pneumothoraces. Interval placement of the due left lower lobe monitor line below. Endotracheal tube and 4.6 cm.  NG tube to stomach.\n\n\nCT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis &#8211; AD protocol:\nNo evidence of aortic dissection, narrowed SMA at its origin. Bilateral consolidation in the dependent portions of the upper and lower lobes, consistent with aspiration and/or pneumonia. Interlobular septal thickening and small bilateral pleural effusions, consistent with pulmonary edema. Indeterminate hypodense lesion in the body of the pancreas. Differential considerations include a cyst and IPMN. Bilateral renal hypodensities, the largest of which are consistent with simple cysts. Heterogeneous thyroid gland, with areas of hypodensity.\n \nBedside TTE: no evidence of papillary muscle rupture, moderate MR present\n\n\nEKG in ED at 6.32AM: NSR, STE in I, II, aVF, V5, V6\nEKG in ED at 7.31AM: RAD, VT, STE in I, aVL, V5,V6\nEKG on CCU Admission: NSR at 113 , RBBB, left posterior fascicular block, 3-4 mm STE in V4-V6, 2-3 mm in II,III, AvF\nRepeat EKG 9 hours after CCU Admission: NSR at 99 , RBBB, left posterior fascicular block, 3-4 mm STE in V4-V6, II,III, AvF resolving.\n\n\nImpression:\n79 yo lady with DM, HTN, HL who presented with lateral STEMI with occluded OM1, s/p BM stent and is now in cardiogenic and septic shock.\n\n\nPlan: \n1.        CV Pump: cardiogenic shock: continue vasopressor and inotrope support with Dobutamine, Levophed, Vasopressin, goal to wean Levophed to reduce afterload and increase CI, continue to give fluid boluses intermittently as she appeared preload dependent possibly due to RV involvement, MAP goal above 65, goal to keep CI above 2.2, f/u urine output with goal to keep above 25, trending lactic acid\n2.        CV Ischemia: STEMI, cont. ASA, Plavix, Heparin, Reopro, holding BB and ACE in setting of hypotension, will check HbA1c\n3.        CV Rhythm: currently NSR, on Tele\n4.        Septic shock: aspiration event vs. possibly CAP, no evidence of other infectious source, covering empirically with Vancomycin/Levaquin IV given absence of recent hospitalization over the past 90 days, checking C.diff, will have low threshold to broaden coverage further if necessary\n5.        HTN: currently hypotensive, holding BP meds\n6.        DM: holding Metformin, RISS\n7.        FEN: NPO for now with NGT on continous suctioning\n8.        Prophylaxis: Heparin IV, PPI IV bid\n9.        Code Status: Full Code \n10.   Dispo: pending resolution of acute medical issues\n____________________________________\nXai-Micah Church, MD  -  Pager #73615\nJunior resident, Department of Internal Medicine\n\n\n\n",

Please see the recent note from cardiology from 06/27/2091. She is status post stenting in 03/2091 and 06/2091. Post her second procedure she also had a large hematoma which has been gradually resolving. \n\n\nShe has type 2 diabetes and her fasting sugars have been very well controlled. She is currently on metformin 1000 mg b.i.d. and glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. She is trying to watch her diet and salt intake. She has not had any symptoms of hypoglycemia. She had lost some weight after her first heart attack but her weight has been stable. \n\n\nHer lisinopril was recently increased by cardiology. She has no exertional chest pain, PND, orthopnea, edema, or claudication. \n\n\nShe has a history of iron deficiency anemia and had refused colonoscopies in the past. At the time of her heart attack she had been intubated and had some coffee grounds noted and also required a blood transfusion. She has not noted any epigastric pain, abdominal pain, melena, or hematochezia. She does take her iron supplements and her stools are dark on the iron supplements. I had discussed with patient and daughter several times that she should get a colonoscopy to evaluate her guaiac iron deficiency anemia but she continues to refuse one. \n\n\nAlso noted on her admissions was that she had a lung nodule and possible pancreatic mass on CT from 03/2091 and 06/2091. She should get a repeat CT in 12/2091. \n\n\nShe is not having any abdominal pain. \n\n\nShe has chronic back pain and osteoarthritis pain. Of note she also had elevated parathyroid levels in the past but refuses to see Endocrinology either in Fayetteville or at United Methodist Behavioral Hospital. \n\n\nPlease see her medication list which was reviewed with the patient and her daughter. \n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is in no acute distress. Blood pressure 132/70. Neck: Supple without JVD or bruits. Lungs: Clear without wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1 and S2. No S3, S4 or bruits. Abdomen: Mildly obese, soft, nontender. She still has some residual hematoma near her right groin. She has a left femoral artery bruit. The hematoma has significantly decreased in size compared to prior visit. No CCE. Distal pulses intact. \n\n\n1. Coronary artery disease. She has no symptoms of decompensated heart failure on her current regimen. Her blood pressure is well controlled with the recent increase in the lisinopril from 20 to 40 mg daily. Check Chem-7. \n\n\nHypomagnesemia. Check followup magnesium level. \n\n\nType 2 diabetes. Her last hemoglobin A1c was 6.1 which is excellent. Continue current medications. \nIron deficiency anemia. She should have a colonoscopy +/- an upper endoscopy but she declines these procedures. She is aware that we have not ruled out colon cancer or adenomatous colonic polyps or other cause for her iron deficiency anemia. Check CBC. \n\n\nHistory of lung nodule and possible pancreatic mass versus IPMN. These were both stable on imaging from 03/2091 and 06/2091. She needs repeat imaging in 6 months. She will follow up with me in 10/2091 so we can get a flu shot and schedule these procedures. \n\n\n\n\n___________________________\nIda Xayachack, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncc:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTD: 07/28/2091 04:38:30\nTR: 7999590\nBackJob ID:  411287\nVoiceJob ID:  17480048\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I confirm that I have\n\ninterviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's\n\ndocumentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the\n\nevaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient. \n\nPlease see the resident's note for further details.\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Syncopal event.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old male\n\nwith a history of atrial fibrillation for which he is on\n\nCoumadin, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease,\n\nhypertension, and prior transient ischemic attack, who had a\n\nsyncopal episode yesterday.  As per report, the patient felt\n\nlightheaded and passed out while he was shaving.  The patient\n\npassed out while using in the bathroom.  The patient was actually\n\ncaught by son before he actually hit the floor.  The patient did\n\nnot strike his head.  There was no loss of consciousness.  The\n\npatient then awoke once he was supine.  The patient later felt\n\nnormal.  The patient states that he did have some antecedent\n\ndiaphoresis and shortness of breath and possible chest\n\npalpitations.  The patient states that he felt like something was\n\njumping inside his body.  The patient does complain of some\n\nfatigue and malaise.  The patient denies having any lower\n\nextremity swelling or pain.  The patient denies having any chest\n\npain at this time.  The patient did have an adenosine MIBI in\n\nMarch 2095, which showed some areas of reversible ischemia over\n\nthe distribution of the left circumflex artery.  The patient's\n\ntransthoracic echocardiogram from March 2095 did show some LVH as\n\nwell as for an ejection fraction of 50% with some global\n\nhypokinesis.  The patient was seen by his primary care physician,\n\nspecifically, Dr. Ross.  The patient was instructed to come to\n\nthe Emergency Department for further evaluation and admission.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vital signs revealed the\n\nfollowing:  The patient's temperature was 99 degrees Fahrenheit. \n\nHeart rate 63 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths per\n\nminute, blood pressure is 151/18, and oxygen saturation was\n\ninterpreted as normal.  General:  Mild-to-moderate discomfort\n\nnoted, daughter at bedside, pleasant.  HEENT:  The patient's head\n\nis normocephalic and atraumatic, no scalp hematomas.  Mucous\n\nmembranes were somewhat dry.  Posterior oropharynx was clear. \n\nNeck:  Supple, no JVD.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation\n\nbilaterally.  No focal rhonchi, rales, or wheezes. \n\nCardiovascular:  Irregularly irregular, distant heart sounds, no\n\ndefinite murmurs, rubs, or gallops were appreciated.  GI: \n\nAbdomen:  Soft, no rebound or guarding, no focal tenderness to\n\npalpation, no palpable pulsatile mass appreciated.  Rectal exam\n\ndeferred.  GU exam deferred.  Skin:  Warm and dry, no rash or\n\nlesions were noted.  Back:  No costovertebral angle tenderness. \n\nThere was no presacral edema.  Extremities:  Warm and well\n\nperfused, trace lower extremity edema noted, no asymmetrical\n\nlower extremity edema.  There were no palpable cords.  Neuro: \n\nThe patient was alert and oriented x3, motor, strength, and\n\nsensation were all grossly intact.  The patient's cranial nerves\n\nare grossly intact.  I did not ambulate the patient.\n\nINITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  The patient is a 70-year-old male\n\nwith a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart\n\nfailure, prior transient ischemic attack, and atrial fibrillation\n\nfor which he is on Coumadin, who presents with a syncopal\n\nepisode.  The patient was sent in to the Emergency Department for\n\nfurther evaluation and workup for this syncopal event. \n\nDifferential diagnosis at this time includes a syncopal event\n\nsecondary to dehydration versus arrhythmia.  I do not feel that\n\nthe patient had a cerebrovascular accident.  The patient will\n\nneed to have screening laboratory studies and formal imaging.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Upon arrival to the Emergency\n\nDepartment, the patient had history and physical exam performed. \n\nThe patient then had a 12-lead EKG performed.  The patient's\n\n12-lead EKG was consistent with atrial fibrillation with some\n\nT-wave flattening noted.  There were no definite acute ischemic\n\nchanges appreciated.  The patient had laboratory studies sent. \n\nThe patient's laboratory studies were notable for a creatinine of\n\n1.69.  The patient does have a history of renal insufficiency. \n\nThe patient's cardiac markers were negative.  The patient's BNP\n\nwas elevated at 1380.  The patient's complete blood count was\n\nnormal.  The patient's coagulation studies were normal patient's\n\ncoagulation studies were notable for an INR of 2.2.  The patient\n\nthen had a noncontrast head CT scan performed.  The patient's\n\nnoncontrast head CT scan results are still pending at this time. \n\nThe patient also had a 2-view chest x-ray ordered.  The patient's\n\nchest x-ray results are also still pending at this time.  Dr.\n\nRoss kindly and promptly saw the patient here in the Emergency\n\nDepartment.  He was in agreement with admitting the patient to\n\nInternal Medicine at this time.  The patient will be admitted\n\nto a monitor bed.  The patient will need to rule out for possible\n\nacute coronary syndrome or cardiac ischemia.  The patient will\n\nneed further monitoring for possible arrhythmia.  The patient was\n\nin agreement with this plan for admission at this time.\n\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSES:\n\n1.  Syncopal event, possibly secondary to an arrhythmia.\n\n2.  Atrial fibrillation.\n\n3.  Renal insufficiency.\n\nDISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to Internal Medicine\n\nand to a monitor bed.\n\nCONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISPOSITION:  Stable and satisfactory.\n\n______________________________\n\nJUSTUS, ELLIS M.D.\n\nD: 05/15/95\n\nT: 05/15/95\n\nDictated By: JUSTUS, ELLIS\n\neScription document:4-4238782 IFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As you know, he is a 70-year-old man who is s/p CABG in May of this year. Today he is doing well folloing his surgery . \n\n\n\nHis past medical history is significant for a coronary artery disease, status post IMI,afib,  CABG, PPM,  hypertension, hyperlipidemia, question of an old stroke.  His current medications include aspirin 81 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, lisinorpill 40 mg, Toprol-XL 10 mg, Prilosec 20 mg, Zocor 40 mg, Hydralazine.Coumadin as directed.\n\n\nAllergies:  No known drug allergies.\n\n\nHe lives in Claxton with his wife, daughter, and grandkids and son-in-law.  He does not drink, smoke or use IV drugs.  He is originally from England.  \n\n\nFamily History:  noncontributory.\n\n\nOn physical examination, his heart rate was 60 and regular,  his blood pressure was 125/70.  Carotids are 2+, good upstrokes, no bruits.  Jugular venous pressure was flat.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  He had a regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border.  Abdomen was benign.  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema of the extremities. Good peripheral pulses.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, this is a 70-year-old man with coronary artery disease,  At this time he is NYHA II. Hre appears a bit volume overloaded. I will add ACE and lasix. Follow up in 1 month. \n\n\n\n\n____________________________________\nXavier Ross, M.D.\n\n\n\n",

I reviewed the resident's note and agree with his documented findings and plan of care.\n\n\nThe patient is a 71 year old man with HTN, DM and high cholesterol, PPM on coumadin for AF, glaucoma, who presented 4 w/a with R facial droop and dysarthria lasting &lt; 1 minute.  Was admitted for TIA w/u and CT scan was negative.  CTA was also normal.  He had had a similar episode in the UK in the past. Was started on a statin and ASA and discharged.  His wife feels he may not be that compliant but his INR was 2.3 today.  It had been 2 when he came in with the TIA&gt;\n\n\nThe exam today showed:\nAcuity was 20/70 OD and Hand motions OS.\nLeft APD\nFundi with large C/D OD and diffuse pallor OS with an opticociliary shunt vessel along the nasal disc.\nRight facial weakness in the sense of eyebrow drop and less wrinkles in the forehead but smile equal.  Was not in UMN fashion.\nMotor, sensory, gait otherwise normal.\n\n\nAssessment:  \nStatus post TIA possibly related to AF\n\nLeft optic neuropathy with signs of chronic compression or ischemia.  The latter is more likely cause (especially since I did not see any mass lesion compressing the L optic nerve on the CT) and is proably secondary to glaucoma.\n\n\nPlan:\nReviewed coumadin food rules with him.\nContinue \nASA and coumadin and statin\nContinued HTN and DM control\nWill touch base with ophthalmology regarding the left optic neuropathy\n\nReturn in 6 months.\n\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\nVictor Meadows, M.D.\nShady Brook Hospital\nNeurology\n\n745-456-4769\nvmeadows@sbhnc.org\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n",

As you recall, he is a very pleasant 71-year-old gentleman with a history of right-sided trigeminal neuralgia. He has pain behind the right eye that has been present for 3 years. He describes it as a very sharp, severe, stabbing pain. He takes Tegretol, which helps but does not completely alleviate the pain. Over the past month the pain has become worse and increasingly intolerable. He has increased his Tegretol dose to 800 mg per day, which is about the limit of what he can tolerate. \n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes, asthma. \n\n\nMEDICATIONS: Levothyroxine, Lyrica, Tegretol, glyburide and metformin. \n\n\nALLERGIES: None. \n\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Cholecystectomy. \n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is retired, a laboratory technician and lives in cincinnati.\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Noncontributory. \n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pleasant, older man in mild distress secondary to the pain. His mental status, cranial nerve examination, strength and sensation were normal. \n\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN: In summary, this is a patient with what seems to be right V1 trigeminal neuralgia. The fact that he responded to the Tegretol is encouraging. I discussed the different options with him including no surgery, radiofrequency rhizotomy, and microvascular decompression. He elected to proceed with a microvascular decompression. I discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient and all his questions were answered. A surgical consent was obtained. The plan is to perform the surgery on 08/31/2135. Prior to proceeding, I would like to obtain a dedicated brain MRI with fine cuts through the posterior fossa to better assess the neurovascular anatomy. \n\n\nI thank you very much and look forward to hearing from you in the future. \n\n\n\n\n___________________________\nJoshua U.

Two weeks ago, he noted intermittent episodes of exertional dyspnea. He was started on albuterol and advair with no improvement. On 08/30/2135, he experienced worsening exertional shortness of breath and mild chest discomfort. He sought medical attention at Natchaug Hospital ED. An initial ECG revealed Q waves in V1-V4. He ruled in for an myocardial infarction with a troponin on 2.0. He was found to be in congestive heart failure. He was given plavix, aspirin, lovenox and IV lasix with improvement in symptoms. \nOn 08/31/2135, he was transferred to Gibson Community Hospital for cardiac catheterization. The results were significant for multivessel coronary artery disease and moderate mitral valve regurgitation with an left ventricular ejection fraction of 25 to 30%. He was referred to Dr. Sebastian Dang for elective cardiac surgical revascularization and possible mitral valve repair. He was discharged to home on 09/02/2135. \nOn 09/03/2135, he developed recurrent left sided chest pressure while at rest. He took 2 SL TNG with improvement in symptoms. He presented to Gibson Community Hospital ED. He was started on IV heparin. Initial cardiac biomarkers were negative. He was found to have an elevated BNP to 2817. A CXR showed congestive heart failure. He was admitted to CAU. He had an episode of chest pressure while at rest that resolved with 1 SL TNG. He is being referred for consideration of cardiac surgery. \n\nIndications\nCongestive Heart Failure\nUnstable Angina                                   \n\nPre-operative risk factors\nWeight (lb): 150.5\nHeight (in): 70.5\nDiabetes type: Diabetes Mellitus Type II\nDiabetes Control: Oral\nDyslipidemia\nPreop Creatinine: 0.93\nHypertension\n\nPrior CV Interventions\n\nOther Past Medical/Surgical History\nHypertension\nHyperlipidemia\nDiabetes Mellitus Type II\nAsthma\nHypothyroidism\nTrigeminal Neuralgia-on lyrica and tegretol\nCholecystectomy\n\nAllergies\nNKA: No Known Allergies\n\nAdmission medications\nAspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) 325 mg PO DAILY\nGlucophage (metformin) 500 mg PO DAILY\nLasix (furosemide) 40 mg PO Bid\nLisinopril 5 mg PO DAILY\nLopressor (metoprolol tartrate) 25 mg PO Bid\nLyrica  75 mg  PO Qam; 75 mg at 5pm, 150 mg at Qhs \nNitroglycerin 0.3 mg (nitroglycerin 1/200 (0.3 mg)) 1 tab SL prn\nSynthroid (levothyroxine sodium) 100 microgram PO DAILY\nTegretol-xr (carbamazepine extended release) 500 mg  PO Bid\n\nCurrent Medications\nAcetylsalicylic acid (aspirin ) 325 MG PO QAM\nAtorvastatin (lipitor ) 80 MG PO QPM\nAtropine sulfate 0.5-1 MG     IV PUSH DAILY\nCarbamazepine (tegretol ) 500 MG PO BID\nDocusate sodium (colace ) 100 MG PO BID\nFurosemide (lasix ) 20 MG PO DAILY\nGlyburide 5 MG PO QAM BEFORE BREAKFAST\nHeparin cardiac sliding scale iv 500-1500 Units/Hr IV CONTINUOUS INFUSION \nInsulin regular inj Sliding Scale SC BID BEFORE BREAKFAST AND BEFORE SUPPER\nIsosorbide dinitrate 10 MG PO TID\nKcl immediate release (potassium chloride immed. rel. ) 20 MEQ PO Q4H\nKcl immediate release (potassium chloride immed. rel. ) 40 MEQ PO Q4H\nLevothyroxine sodium 100 MCG PO DAILY\nMetoprolol tartrate (lopressor ) 12.5 MG PO TID\nNitroglycerin 1/200 (0.3 mg) 1 TAB SL Q 5 mins X 3 doses\nPotassium chloride sustained release tab 40 MEQ PO Q4H\nPotassium chloride sustained release tab 20 MEQ PO Q4H\nPregabalin (lyrica ) 75 MG PO at 5 PM\nPregabalin (lyrica ) 75 MG PO in am\nPregabalin (lyrica ) 150 MG     PO bedtime\nRanitidine hcl (zantac ) 150 MG PO BID\nSodium chloride 0.9% flush 3 ML IV Q2H\nSodium chloride 0.9% flush 3 ML IV Q8H\n\nPreop Cardiac Status\nMyocardial Infarction:  (08/30/2135, 09/03/2135)\nWhen: &gt;6 Hours and &lt; 24 Hours\nHeart Failure\nNYHA Classification: NYHA CLASS III\nCardiac Presentation: NSTEMI, Unstable Angina\n\nPreoperative Hemodynamics and Diagnostic Testing\n\nEcho\n-surface echocardiogram ordered \n\nECG\n-SB, Q waves in V1-V4\n\nCarotid Non-Invasive Study\n-09/01/2135 CNIS's reveal normal (B) ICA's \n\nSocial History\nOccupation: retired technician\nOther Notes: -married; 2 adult children\n\nFamily History\nDiabetes\nCVA/TIA\nOther notes: -Father died of an myocardial infarction at age 74-Mother with DM, died of cerebral vascular accident or myocardial infarction at age 84 \n\nReview of Systems\n-as mentioned in HPI\n\nPhysical Exam\nBP (Right): 100/50; BP (Left): 100/50; Pulse: 54; Rhythm: SB\nGENERAL: Well appearing, thin gentleman lying in bed in no acute distress\nHEENT: Oropharynx benign, moist mucous membranes, anicteric \nTEETH: In good repair \nNECK: Supple, no JVD\nCV: RRR, S1S2, 2/6 SM\nPULM: Clear bilaterally\nSKIN: No lesions or rashes\nEXTREMETIES: Warm, no edema\nABD: Well healed RUQ incision, +BS, soft, non-tender, no organomegaly\nRECTAL: Normal tone, no masses, enlarged prostate, soft formed brown guaiac (-) stool\nNEURO: Alert and oriented x 3, non-focal \nSaphenous Vein: Bilateral GSV's appear suitable on standing\nPulses: (B) \nCarotid: 2+; Brachial: 2+; Radial: 2+; Ulnar: 1+\nFemoral: 2+; Popliteal: trace ; Post Tibial: trace ; Dorsalis Pedis: 1+\nBruits: (B) \nFemoral Bruit: none appreciated ; Carotid Bruit: (L) present \n\nChest X-ray\n-09/01/2135 Pa/Lat CXR: edema, (B) effusions \n\nMost Recent Labs (since admission)\n--  --\n2135/09/04 09:13 - WBC... 5.3 th/cmm\n2135/09/04 09:13 - Hgb... 11.0 gm/dl (L)\n2135/09/04 09:13 - Hct... 31.3 % (L)\n2135/09/04 09:13 - Plt... 211 th/cumm\n--  --\n2135/09/03 15:06 - P Na... 127 mmol/L (L)\n2135/09/04 07:42 - P K... 4.3 mmol/L\n2135/09/03 15:06 - P Cl... 91 mmol/L (L)\n2135/09/03 15:06 - P TCO2... 28.1 mmol/L\n2135/09/03 15:06 - P BUN... 18 mg/dl\n2135/09/03 15:06 - P Cre... 0.93 mg/dl\n2135/09/04 07:42 - P Glu... 131 mg/dl (H)\n2135/09/03 15:06 - Phos... 3.5 mg/dl\n2135/09/03 15:06 - Mg... 1.7 meq/L\n--  --\n2135/09/04 07:42 - CPK... 47 U/L (L)\n2135/09/03 15:09 - TROPON...

He sufferred a NSTEMI on 8/30/35. A cath at that time revealed an occluded mid LAD lesion, a 75% ostial OM2 stenosis, a 90% OM4 stenosis, and a non-dominant RCA with a 90% stenosis. His LVEF was estimated at 25-30% with moderate MR. He was discharged home on 9/02/35 to orbit for future CABG. \n9/03/35 He was admitted to Natchaug Hospital secondary to recurrent rest pain. n 9/04/35 Echo revealing moderate MR with no other significant valvular abnormalities. There was segmental left ventricular dysfunction involving the septal, apical, inferior, and anterior territories. EF 55%.  There was segmental right ventricular dysfunction involving the apex. The plan was for this patient to undergo CABG; however the patients wife was involved in a serious MVA, and with further discussion the decision was made to take him to the cath lab to attempt PCI so that the patient could be with his wife as soon as possible. \n9/05/35 He was taken to the CCL. mid LAD had a 100% occlusion after the D1. The D1 was a small vessel with an ostial, eccentric, 90% lesion. The OM2 had a 60% eccentric lesion that did not appear flow limiting. The LPDA had a 95% complex lesion in the proximal third. He underwent stenting of the native mid LAD with a  Xience OTW 2.5 X 23mm stent with an excellent result. This was followed by kissing-balloon angioplasty of the ostium of the 1st diagonal and the LAD. The pre-intervention stenosis was 90% with 0% residual stenosis. Finally, stenting of the proximal third of the left PDA was performed using a Xience V 2.5 x 15mm and a 2.5 x 12mm stent. The pre-intervention stenosis was 95% with 0% residual stenosis. At the end of the case, there was TIMI III flow throughout with no perforation or dissection. The patient remained stable throughout the rest of the admission with no further chest discomfort. He was discharged home on 9/06/35. \n\nSince his discharge he has noticed that he was dyspneic with lying flat. He has also noticed some exertional fatigue and dyspnea. He presented to Natchaug Hospital for further evaluation.  His ECG showed no acute changes, CXR consistent with mild CHF.  He has been aggressively diuresed with improvement  in his level of dyspnea. He was transferred to GCH for a repeat cardiac catheterization. \nCath today revealing:  Widely patent LAD and LPDA stents. Balloon angioplasty site of proximal D1 patent. Nondominant RCA with 90% proximal lesion Severe cardiomyopathy with mid-distal anterior, apical, and mid-distal inferior hypokinesis. EF 25% with LVEDP 20. Moderate mitral regurgitation.\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n   1. CAD- details above \n2. DM - on glyburide and metformin \n3. Trigeminal neuralgia - on lyrica and tegretol \n4.

Source of bleeding not clear.  Pattern most typical of LGIB, likely diverticular with significant decline in hematocrit, painless, moderate volume BRBPR.  Agree no real pain for ischemic colitis, though wbc elevated.  No fevers, chills, other GI symptoms or exposure for infectious colitis.  Given black stools, aspirin use, history of PUD, upper bleed also possible, though presentation with red blood and hemodynamic stability atypical for this.  Given insecurity in type of bleed, agree with both EGD and colonoscopy.  \n\n\n\nEGD and colonoscopy this morning\n\nHold aspirin\n\nContinue QD PPI\n\nIf hematocrit drops further, would transfuse 1-2 units to hct of 28-30\n\n\n\nWhitney Short, MD\n\nGI Fellow\n\nPage 67094\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n",

She is a 77-year-old woman with longstanding history of tobacco use of greater than 100-pack years quitting approximately eight years ago. She suffers from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, and what appears to be a recent diagnosis of COPD. She has always been very limited in her activity suffering from back pain, and has never been in any type of regular exercise routine. She recently has noticed dyspnea on exertion over the past two to three months and has been treated with several prednisone tapers as well as an albuterol nebulizer at home and an albuterol inhaler. With these treatments, her dyspnea improved, but would worsen as the steroids were tapered.  She does report some episodes of chest heaviness, which she describes as a heavy feeling in her chest, which will last for minutes at a time. These are not exertionally related and are occurring approximately once per week. She was placed on Nexium with some improvement, but does feel as if she will still develop these episodes. \n\n\n\nTo further evaluate her symptoms of persistent cough and shortness of breath, she underwent a CT scan to evaluate for pulmonary embolus. This was performed on 05/20/2101 and did not show any evidence of PE, however, there was coronary artery calcification with plaque noted in the left main coronary artery. There was a focal 9 mm aneurysm of the right coronary artery. She was then referred to me for further evaluation.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPast medical history:\n\n   Hypertension. \n\nHyperlipidemia. \n\nGlucose intolerance. \n\nLeft bundle branch block. \n\nDiverticular bleed. \n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease. \n\nHypothyroidism. \n\nCOPD.\n\n\n\nCurrent Medications:\n\n prednisone taper\n\nhydrochlorothiazide 50 mg qd\n\npotassium chloride 10 mEq qd\n\nlisinopril 30 mg qd\n\naspirin 81 mg qd\n\ncalcium supplement 600 mg qd\n\nlevothyroxine 25 mcg qd\n\nLipitor 10 mg qd\n\nCelexa 40 mg qd\n\nalbuterol inhaler; Dir: and nebulizer\n\nmultivitamins\n\n\n\nAllergies:\n\n\t\t\t\n\nAllergy   She reports receiving Halothane gas remotely with the development of jaundice at the time of her hysterectomy.\n\nDrug allergy   Halothane gas, which caused hepatitis per her report.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFamily history:\n\n   Notable for her father with myocardial infarction at 54.  Mother with \"an enlarged heart,\" who died at 82.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSocial history:\n\n   She quit smoking eight years ago, previously smoked two packs per day for 35 years.  She lives alone but her daughter lives above her in the same building.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tReview of systems:\n\n   She denies any significant change in weight.  She has intermittent headaches relieved with Advil.  She reports chronic cough and wheeze, which has been improved on prednisone.  She has shortness of breath with exertion but denies exertional chest pain.  No lower extremity edema, palpitations, or dizzy spells.  She reports her reflux symptoms are improved on her Nexium.  She has no history of stroke, no history of anemia.  She reports her sugars have been diet controlled.  Otherwise extended review of systems was negative.\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n\t\t\t\n\n-Pulse:   70\n\n-BP: 142/70  \n\n-General:   She is an elderly woman in no distress and comfortable at rest\n\n-Skin:   Free of rashes\n\n-Heent:   benign\n\n-Neck:   JVP was at 5.  She had 2+ carotids without bruits\n\n-Chest:   Lungs are clear without significant wheeze\n\n-Cardiac:   Regular, S1 and S2 without murmurs\n\n-Abdomen:   Soft with a nontender reducible ventral hernia\n\n-Extremities:   She had no edema in her extremities with 2+ distal pulses\n\n-Neuro:   She is alert and oriented\n\n-weight:   185 pounds\n\n\n\n\t\t\tEKG:\n\n    demonstrated sinus rhythm at 70 with a left bundle branch block.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAssessment and plan:\n\n   Gabrielle Oreilly has multiple risk factors for coronary disease including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, a positive family history, and heavy tobacco use in the past. She presently has had recurrent bouts of a COPD flare, which has been responsive to prednisone and albuterol nebulizer therapy. Her chest CT scan demonstrates plaque in the left main coronary artery as well as a right coronary artery aneurysm. I do believe she needs further evaluation first by functional study, and I will arrange an adenosine stress test and consider cardiac catheterization to further define her anatomy with her multiple high-risk features and abnormalities as seen on her recent CT scan. She will continue a slow taper with possible addition of other inhalers to control her COPD.\n\n\n\nPlan: \n\n1. Adenosine MIBI to evaluate for ischemia in distributions of the left system as well as the RCA aneurismal segment. \n\n2. Treatment of her emphysema as per your office. \n\n3. I will see her again in follow up in one month and consider cardiac catheterization for further evaluation. \n\n4. I have instructed her to proceed to the emergency room with the development of any significant chest pain or progressive shortness of breath.\n\n\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\n\t\t\t\n\nprednisone     taper\n\nhydrochlorothiazide 50 mg   qd\n\npotassium chloride 10 mEq   qd\n\nlisinopril 30 mg   qd\n\naspirin 81 mg   qd\n\ncalcium supplement 600 mg   qd\n\nlevothyroxine 25 mcg   qd\n\nLipitor 10 mg   qd\n\nCelexa 40 mg   qd\n\nalbuterol inhaler     and nebulizer\n\nmultivitamins    \n\npotassium supplement 10 mEq   qd\n\nAlbuterol Nebulizer    \n\n\n\nIt is a pleasure to share in her care and I will continue to keep you updated. \n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\nWendy Tapia M.D.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSigned electronically by   Wendy  Tapia M.D.  on  Jun 17, 2101     \n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n",

She made this appt,\nbecause she had heavy vaginal bleeding 2 weeks ago.  She normally has her\nperiods q28d, with 5 days of heavy flow.  Her last period lasted for 15 days\nwith the usual clots and heavy flow.  The bleeding stopped 2 weeks ago, and\nthere is no spotting now.  She denies any abd pain.  She denies possiblity of\npregnancy, although she has unprotected intercourse with a longtime partner.\n \nPMH:  staph aureus UTI 2066\n      h/o multiple UTI's\n      last PAP in 5/64 - squamous metaplasia\n \nAllergies:  NKDA\n \nMeds:  MVI, Vit E, Calcium supplement\n \nSHx:  former banker,but now investment consultant.  No tob, EtOH,\nIVDA.  Reports 1 blood transufion before 2064 when she had a UTI.  Divorced.\nNo children.\n \nFhx:  M 90 - DM, esophageal CA\n      F - died of old age\n      5 brothers and 3 sisters\n      2 brothers and 1 sister with HTN, 1 sister with DM.\n \nPE:  pleasant, cooperative, talkative, obese, NAD\nVS:  P96  BP 162/100\nSkin:  warm, dry, no rashes\nHEENT:  NC AT  EOMI  PERRL 3/3-> 2/2, OP clear\nNeck:  no LAD or thyromegaly, carotids 2+ s bruits, JVP 6 cm\nLungs:  CTA B\nCV:  RRR S1 S2 no m/r/g\nBreasts:  symmetric.  NO palpable masses\nAbd:  obese, NT ND + BS\nBack:  no CVA, spinal, paraspinal tenderness\nRectal:  heme negative, no masses\nPelvic:  normal external genitalia,  mild vaginal prolapse.  Cervix normal.  No\nlesions or masses.  PAP samples taken.  Bimanual exam unremarkable \nExt:  trace to 1+ BLE edema (pretibial)     \nNeuro:  nonfocal\n \nImpression:  54 yo perimenopausal woman.\nPlan:\n1.  GYN - prolonged menstrual cycle likely from perimenopausal state.  Since\nthis was her first episode of prolonged bleeding, will not pursue further w/u\nat this point.  Pt given reassurance, and asked to continue to record the dates\nand duration of her menses.  Pt denied h/o fibroids or FHx of GYN cancer. \n \n2.  CV - pt reports h/o BP's of 160/80 in the past.  She was 162/100 today.\nShe was very reluctant to initiate any BP medicine (I suggested atenolol 25 mg\npo QAM), and want to try diet and exercise first.  She understands the health\nrisks of HTN and knows that it is very common among African Americans.  Will\nfollow this issue closely and readdress at next visit.\n \n3.  Health maintenance - await PAP results.  Will check CBC, SMA7 and lipid\npanel today.  Will schedule screening mammogram at next visit.\n \n4.  f/u with me in 1 month. \n \n \n \n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPreceptor EVANS,NELSON MAC,M.D. Note:\nSeen with Dr. Thorpe and discussed.  Is perimenopausal, had 15-day period once. \nNo pap since 2064.  BP was 162/100.  Dr. Thorpe did a pap, will follow periods. \nSUspect she is hypertensive, but she is reluctant to take meds.  Discussed\nrisks of htn with her.  She will FU with Dr. Thorpe.\n ******** Approved by Preceptor EVANS,NELSON MAC,M.D. ********\n\n\n\n\n",

The patient has a known \n\nhistory of coronary artery disease and most recently had a stent \n\nplaced in April of 2075.  The patient had an episode of chest \n\ntightness with dyspnea while walking to catch a bus.  The patient \n\nstates that this is unusual for her.  She does not usually have \n\ndiscomfort with exertion since having her stent placed.  That did \n\nresolve with rest and now the patient states she had a just \"trace\" \n\nof chest tightness throughout the day otherwise.  The patient came \n\nto Abbeville General Hospital and while walking uphill towards \n\nthe hospital entrance she had recurrence of her discomfort.  The \n\npatient is pain-free on arrival to the emergency department.   \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per the written note. \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, \n\nangioplasty, stent, coronary artery disease, pulmonary \n\nhypertension. \n\nMEDICATIONS:  Glyburide, aspirin, Lasix, and otherwise as per the \n\nwritten note.\n\nALLERGIES:  Actifed.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished \n\nfemale in no acute distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.9, pulse \n\n87, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 161/93.  Oxygen saturation \n\nis 98% on room air.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are \n\nequal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular \n\nmotions are intact.  LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No \n\ncrackles.  No wheezes.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  \n\nPhysical exam is otherwise as per the written note.  \n\nLABORATORY EVALUATION: Labs are significant for an EKG which shows \n\na sinus rhythm at 87 beats per minute.  There are 1-mm ST \n\ndepressions in leads V5 and V6.  This was compared to a prior EKG \n\nfrom July 2075 and was found to be without significant change.  The \n\nonly new change on the EKG is that a previously biphasic T-wave in \n\nV4 is now upright.  Glucose is 215, BUN 21, creatinine 1.1, sodium \n\n140, potassium 3.9, chloride 100, bicarb 32, CK 321, MB 3.1, trauma \n\n0.07, calcium 9.4, white count 8.8, hematocrit 40.1, platelets 247, \n\nPT 11.3, PTT 25.0.  Urinalysis shows no blood, no leukocyte \n\nesterase, no nitrates.  Chest x-ray shows no infiltrate, no \n\npulmonary edema.\n\nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen and evaluated \n\nin the emergency department with labs and studies obtained as \n\ndocumented above.  The patient's history is concerning for angina.  \n\nThe patient received an aspirin, as well as Lopressor, while in the \n\nemergency department.  She has remained pain-free throughout her \n\nperiod of observation while in the emergency department.  The \n\npatient will require serial cardiac enzymes due to her most recent \n\nchest discomfort being en route to the hospital and if these are \n\nunremarkable the patient will require a functional cardiac study \n\nsuch as an exercise tolerance test. \n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Angina.\n\nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was \n\nadmitted to the hospital in satisfactory condition. \n\n___________________________________                    JM057/26484 \n\nLATRISHA ERVIN, M.D.       LE72                        D:12/04/75 \n\n                                                       T:12/04/75 \n\nDictated by:  LATRISHA ERVIN, M.D.       LE72 \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Apparently he has had guaiac positive stools and has\nundergone a colonoscopy with the identification of four polyps. \nThree have been removed and he then had a GI bleed.  This has been\nreevaluated and he has been stable.  The fourth polyp will need to\nbe removed at a later time.  At this point, his aspirin has been\ndiscontinued for a number of days and the Lopid was also\ndiscontinued apparently because of increased liver function tests. \nHis current medications therefore include Lasix 40 mg per day,\nMetoprolol 25 mg qd, Nifedipine XL 30 mg qd.  He is aware of a\nbelching and burping sensation after eating but otherwise no\nexertional or other related symptoms.  He is reasonably active but\nsomewhat limited by his claudication.\n \nOn exam today, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 130/70,\na heart rate of 65 and regular.  Head and neck were unremarkable. \nChest is clear.  Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distension\nat 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 are normal with a\nphysiologic split.  There is an S4 and a I/VI systolic ejection\nmurmur at the left sternal border.  Abdominal exam was\nunremarkable.  Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.  \n \nHis resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus\nrhythm with left axis deviation and a nonspecific left\nintraventricular conduction delay.\n \nJacob Bautista, M.D.\nRe:  Umstead, Kenneth\nJuly 04, 2073\nPage 2\n \n \nI think Mr. Umstead is basically doing quite well.  It would be of\nvalue to repeat an exercise test since he has not had one since\n2069.  He had minimal ischemia at that time.  There are no symptoms\nthat would prompt cardiac catheterization at this point and we will\nsee how he does on the exercise test with the objective findings. \n \n \nIf any problems develop, please don't hesitate to contact me. \nThank you very much for allowing me to help with his care.\n \nKindest personal regards.\n \nSincerely yours,\n \n \n \nMarshall O. Lehman, M.D.\n \nDD: 07/04/73\nDT: 07/16/73\nDV: 07/04/73\nMOL/troutman\n \nWILSON MEDICAL CENTER\n79 Pinecrest Rd.\nTonkawa, WA 67495\n \n ******** Approved but not reviewed by Attending Provider ********\n\n\n\n\n",

He feels his legs are better and\nthat he can walk greater distances. He feels very comfortable. \n \nHis current medications include Metoprolol 50 mg per day,\nNifedipine XL 60 mg per day, Lasix 20 mg per day. \n \nOn exam today, he has a blood pressure of 146/76, a heart rate of\n65 and regular. Weight 210 pounds. Head and neck unremarkable.\nChest is clear. Cardiac exam is notable for an S4 and a I/VI\nsystolic ejection murmur. The rest of his exam was unremarkable.\n \nResting 12 lead electrocardiogram is unchanged demonstrating normal\nsinus rhythm and a left axis deviation. There is a nonspecific\nintraventricular conduction delay. \n \nI think Mr. Umstead is doing very well. He would like to have his\narterial pulses rechecked noninvasively and I tried to arrange that\nschedule. In addition, his Metoprolol has been only once a day and\nif he can tolerate it twice a day he will have a better control and\nmore prolonged risk prevention. I suggest that we increase it to 50\nmg bid. I also told him how to take his pulse and he can keep an\neye on it. If it drops too low we can reduce the dose. He asked\nthat I see him again in about six months for routine re-evaluation\nand I will be happy to do so. If any problems develop in the\ninterim please do not hesitate to contact me. \n \nThank you for allowing me to help with his care. \n \nKindest regards.\n \nKenneth Umstead\nMR #401-10-87-8                   -2-           December 19, 2073\n \nSincerely yours,\n \n \n \n \n \nMarshall O.

His primary limitation had been\nhis claudication, but he feels that he can walk better now than in\nthe past.  We had a repeat evaluation of his segmental leg pressure\nand volumes, and these actually were unchanged from a prior study\ntwo years ago.  The post volume recordings were normal in each leg. \nSystolic pressure gradients were present in the right leg\nconsistent with mild anterior tibial/dorsalis pedis disease.  No\nsystolic pressure gradients were found in the left leg.  These were\nunchanged from January, 2072.  Mr. Umstead feels that he can be more\nphysically active and is less limited.\n \nHis current medical regimen includes Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d.,\nNifedipine XL 60 mg q.d., and Lasix 20 mg q.d.\n \nOf note, in October, 2073, he was found by colonoscopy to have four\npolyps which were removed.  Apparently, no malignant cells were\nseen in the pathologic specimens.\n \nOn exam, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 122/68, heart\nrate 63 and regular, weight 205 lbs.  HEENT unremarkable.  Chest\nwas clear.  Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distention at 30\ndegrees, PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 normal but physiologically\nsplit.  There was an S4 and a I/VI systolic ejection murmur at the\nlower left sternal border.  Abdominal exam was unremarkable. \nExtremities show no edema or cyanosis.\n \nHis resting 12 lead EKG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm, left axis\ndeviation, and persisting X waves across the precordium consistent\nwith his left anterior hemiblock.\n \nI think Mr. Umstead is doing quite well.  He asked that I see him\nagain in six months for routine re-evaluation, and I would be happy\nto do so. If any problems develop in the interim please don't\nhesitate to contact me.  Thank you for allowing me to participate\nin his care.\n \nKenneth Umstead\nMR#  401-10-87-8              -2-            Jun 04, 2074\n \nWith best regards. \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nMarshall O.

He developed gait instability and began confusing family members with each other, and being confused about whether the house he was in was his own.  This increased in severity over the past 3-4 days.  He complains of some weakness in his left leg but otherwise has had no other focal motor or sensory deficits. He has had no recent fevers, chills, SOB, sudden motor or sensory loss.   No new incontinence.\n\nThis history was limited by patient   s inability to cooperate.\n\nED COURSE:  Tox screen and metabolic workup in ED were both negative. CXR and U/A performed showing no infectious processes.  Head CT was performed showing no change from prior, though there was a small increase in the size of the lateral ventricles possibly suggestive of normal pressure hydrocephalus.  LP was negative.  Pt was admitted to Internal Medicine for further workup of recent change in mental status and neuro/psych consult.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\nCerebellar stroke: 1/82.  Coumadin d/c'd 8/82, Aggrenox started. Felt better risk/benefit profile \nPVD\nS/p L CEA: 1/81\nColonic polyps\nHiatal hernia \nDuodenal ulcer\nHypertension \nHyperlipidemia\nBPH \nDiabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy \nUrethral stricture: Sees Dr Valle\nDementia: Followed by Dr Umali. Felt mixed vascular and AD dementia. On ACH inhibitor. Started Namenda 11/82.\nBundle branch block: EKG 7/82 NSR with first degree a-v block and LBBB with LAD. EKG 10/83 normal sinus rhythm with first-degree AV block and occasional blocked APC. There is a nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay with a borderline superior axis. There are nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.\nRenal insufficiency, baseline creatinine 1.6-2.2\nDepression \nVitamin D deficiency\n\t\t\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION \nAtenolol 25MG PO QD \nAvandia (ROSIGLITAZONE) 2MG PO BID \nAricept (DONEPEZIL HCL) 10 MG PO QD \nAggrenox (ASPIRIN + DIPYRIDAMOLE) 1 CAPSULE PO bid \nLipitor 20 MG PO QD \nNamenda (MEMANTINE) 10 MG PO BID \nFish OIL CAPSULE (OMEGA-3-FATTY ACIDS) 1000 MG PO BID \n\nALLERGIES:  Ace Inhibitors - Cough, escitalopram - GI Intolerance \n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Significant family history for DM.\n \nSOCIAL HISTORY: Lives with wife who is primary caretaker. Nonsmoker, no EtOH per report.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\nVS: T=97.2, HR=80, BP=174/76, RR=20, 94% on RA\nGen: WAWN, NAD, lying in bed speaking in complete sentences, tangential thoughts\nHEENT: NC/AT.  PERRLA, arcus senilis. EOMI, no nystagmus. Nl oropharynx, MMM. \nCV: RRR, no m/r/g\nChest: CTAB\nAbd: Obese, soft, NT ND. +nl BS\nExt: No edema, warm, well perfused\nNeuro: AAOx2 (person, place). Tangential/circumstantial speech pattern. CN II-XII intact. Motor strength 5/5 BUE, 5/5 RLE, 4/5 on L knee extension, otherwise 5/5 on LLE.  Sensory intact BUE/BLE. Coordination WNL on finger-to-nose bilat.  Gait not assessed. \n\nLABS\nNa 144, K 4.1, Cl 106, CO2 27.4, Ca 9.4, PO4 2.0, Mg 1.7, BUN 23, Cr 1.7, Gluc 124\nTox panel negative\nCSF sugar 79, TP 59, colorless, clear, no xanthochromia, 1RBC, no WBC, otherwise neg.\nWBC 7.1, HCT 39.9, Plt 192, RDW 14.4, MCV 89\nU/A negative\n\nRADIOLOGY\nMRI Brain (7/02/84)\nNo acute infarction.\nChronic right basal ganglia and bilateral cerebellar infarctions, stable from prior.\nMild progression of periventricular and deep white matter T2  hyperintensity which is nonspecific, likely relating to progression of small vessel ischemic disease.\nInterval enlargement of ventricles and sulci consistent with progression of cortical volume loss.\n\nCXR (7/02/84):  WNL\n\nCT Brain (7/02/84)\nNo evidence of an acute intracranial process.\nMildly increased prominence of the lateral ventricles with increased periventricular hypoattenuation.  Although this likely represents microangiopathic changes with commensurate ventricular prominence, consider normal pressure hydrocephalus in the correct clinical setting.\n\nEKG:  Sinus rhythm, 1st degree AV block with atrial bigemeny. Left axis deviation and LVH by R in aVL >11.\n\nASSESSMENT & PLAN\n87yo M with h/o Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathic (carotid stenosis s/p CEA, PVD) who presents with two weeks of increasing lethargy, disorientation, gait instability and visual hallucinations.  The etiology of this downturn remains unclear.  Given his normal temperature, normal CXR and normal U/A, an infectious etiology is unlikely.  Concern for a stroke-related etiology, either embolic or lacunar, is unlikely given CT and MRI results.  However, microembolic disease may be a possibility.  Given the relatively rapid onset of symptoms, worsening Alzheimer   s dementia is less likely, though often onset of Alzheimer   s may appear to have a rapid onset simply because a threshold of recognition by family members has been reached while the process itself was in fact more protracted.  As suggested in the CT results, normal pressure hydrocephalus may be a possibility, though the lack of incontinence makes this less likely. LP performed in the ED was diagnostic and not therapeutic for NPH.  One further diagnosis to consider would be an encephalopathic process, perhaps due to hypertension.\n\nA more psychiatric etiology should also be considered in this patient.  Depression can often manifest itself with lethargy and disorientation, especially in the elderly. However, it is difficult to adequately assess this in the absence of a caretaker, as Mr Umstead is currently difficult to direct with questioning.\n\nDementia:  CXR, U/A negative. CT/MRI negative for acute embolic events.  Most likely etiologies are worsening vascular vs Alzheimer   s dementia.\nwill d/w attending\nconsider psychiatric consult\nContinue Namenda for presumed Alzheimer   s\nWill consult neuro for management of Alzheimer   s and further workup of possible NPH\n\nH/o cerebellar stroke: Currently on Aggrenox (not on Coumadin due to fall risk), will continue.\n\nNIDDM: Will start RISS\n\nHyperlipidemia: Continue Lipitor 20mg PO QD\n\nHTN: metoprolol\n\nProphylaxis: already on Aggrenox for embolic ppx.\n\nCode Status: Will need to discuss with wife tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\nJacob V Ure, MD\nPager # 02664\n\n\n\n\n",

Mr. \nOcampo gets only semi-erections.  He was quite depressed about this \nissue during March, but he feels that his mood has improved.  His \ndaughter, Urbina, did talk to me in the hallway about concerns that her \nfather might be depressed although he feels that this was a significant \ncomponent of the issue.  He had not had chest pain, chest pressure or \nfainting spells.  He has had no nausea, diarrhea, vomiting or \nconstipation.  Urinary symptoms are stable.  His neurological status is \nfine. He tried to lose 5 pounds by exercising and was successful.\n\nEXAM:  On physical examination today his blood pressure is 130/74.  His \nHEENT exam is unremarkable.  His chest is clear.  His heart shows no \nmurmurs.  His abdominal examination is benign.  His rectal is guaiac \nnegative with a smooth prostate.  I gave him a pack of stool guaiac \ncards.  \n\nASSESSMENT:  I will give him a prescription of Viagra and I gave him \nappropriate patient education.  I will see him in six months.  I will \nget some laboratory tests and write him a letter.  We will be tuned \ninto the issue of depression going forward.\n\n \n_______________________________ \nKenneth X.

Sylvester, Jr., M.D.\nHolden District Hospital\n62 Ferry Road Cardiology\nFoxborough, TX  58771\n\n\nDear Ken:\n\nMr. Ocampo returns to the office following his recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  As you know, Dr. Todd Banks took him to the operating room on August 17th, at which point, he underwent multivessel bypass surgery with placement of a left internal mammary artery to his LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to his PDA, first obtuse marginal, and second obtuse marginal.  He tolerated the procedure uneventfully.  His postoperative course was notable for intermittent atrial fibrillation for which he was eventually started on amiodarone therapy.  He also had some difficulty with urinary retention and had a Foley placed, which has stayed in since discharge.  He spent approximately 10 days in Gadsden Medical and has now been discharged to home.  Currently, he complains of a variety of musculoskeletal complaints involving his upper chest and left arm; however, he denies symptoms of active angina, congestive failure, or sensed arrhythmias.  He is slowly recovering his overall strength.\n\nThe last blood studies available to me indicate a random glucose of 118, creatinine of 1.1, normal liver function studies, cholesterol of 124, triglyceride of 124, HDL 39, LDL 60, hematocrit of 33.3.\n\nOn a regimen of amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Niferex 150 mg p.o. q.d., p.r.n. Tylenol No. 3, Hytrin 10 mg p.o. q.d., Proscar 5 mg p.o. q.d., Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. q.d., Pletal 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., possibly simvastatin at 20 mg p.o. q.d.\n\nPhysical exam today reveals a pleasant male in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/50, heart rate 65 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 183 pounds.  The neck is supple, JVP flat, carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities reveal markedly diminished peripheral pulses and 1+ pedal edema.\n\nElectrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 60, PR interval 0.14, QRS 0.12, QT 0.38, axis -20 degrees.  There is evidence of left bundle-branch block with secondary ST and T-wave changes.  An echocardiogram performed prior to discharge revealed mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with a global ejection fraction of 40% at a time when he had a very rapid heart rate.  No subsequent echocardiogram has been performed when he is in sinus rhythm.\n\nImpression and Plan:  Mr. Ocampo is making a slow but study recovery from his multivessel coronary bypass graft surgery.  I suggested he undergo repeat echocardiogram to document current left ventricular function now that he is back in sinus rhythm.  I told him he would stay on amiodarone for approximately 3-6 months, and assuming, he was in normal sinus rhythm throughout this time period, his amiodarone would then be discontinued.  At that time, I would also discontinue his Coumadin.  In addition, at the time of his diagnostic catheterization, he had evidence for severe peripheral vascular disease, and he understands that when he has completed his recovery from his recent surgery, I would strongly encourage further evaluation of his lower extremity arterial system with an eye toward potential percutaneous intervention.  In addition, I have asked him to obtain copies of his discharge summary from the Gadsden Medical Center.  I would like to resume ACE inhibitor therapy in light of his significant CAD and probable left ventricular dysfunction.  He will have routine blood studies obtained today.  I would target his LDL cholesterol to the 70 range.  Beyond this, I have not altered his current regimen.\n\nThank you very much for allowing me to assist in his care.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nNicholas Gomes, M.D.\n\n\nDictated By: Nicholas Gomes\n\n\neScription document:5-3575980 AFFocus\n\n\n\nDD: 09/13/93\nDT: 09/14/93\nDV: 09/13/93\n\n\n\n",

As you know, her course was complicated by heparin induced thrombocytopenia, and she has been continued on Coumadin anticoagulation.  She has done relatively well in five weeks since surgery and her energy level has improved.  The major ongoing symptoms is aching in the upper part of the sternum, and an opening in the lower part of the incision which drains some purulent material.  She also has a suture and her leg which has worked its way to the surface and causes some discomfort.  Her breathing is much better than preoperatively, and she has had no chest pain.  She has very mild residual dyspnea.  She has had mild edema at times, but it has largely resolved.  She has had no fever.\n\n\n\nReview of Systems:                                                                                                  .\n\nAll of the following are normal or negative.  GENERAL:  night sweats, fever and chills.  HEAD AND NECK: headaches, hoarseness.  RESPIRATORY: cough, coughing up blood.  CARDIOVASCULAR: see history above.  GASTROINTESTINAL: frequent heartburn or indigestion, difficulty swallowing, black or tarry stools, nausea/vomiting.  URINARY: frequent urination at night, urinary tract infections, blood in urine.  NEUROLOGIC: transient paralysis, seizures, visual loss in one eye.  HEMATOLOGIC: easy bruising.  SKIN: new rashes or eruptions, poor healing of foot sores, moles that are changing size.  ENDOCRINE: elevated blood sugars, thyroid problems.  MUSCULOSKELETAL: low back pain, joint pains, joint swelling.\n\n\n\nFamily and Social History:\n\nFamily and social history have not changed.  There is no pertinent new information which has bearing on the current problems.\n\n\n\nPhysical Examination: .\n\nShe looks quite well.  Her blood pressure is 160/80.  Central venous pressure is normal and lungs are clear.  There is mild tenderness with no redness or swelling over the upper end of the sternum, and there is a 1 cm in diameter opening of the incision at the lower end, with sero-purulent drainage.  Lungs are clear.  Heart shows regular rhythm and I hear no rub or murmur.  Liver is not palpable and there is no edema.  There was a small end of a suture from the small leg incision, which I clipped off.\n\n\n\nElectrocardiogram: .\n\nNormal sinus rhythm.  Anterior T-wave inversion, somewhat to tracing.  Before the operation.\n\n\n\nOverall, Mrs. Ulibarri is improved.  I asked him concerns about possible smoldering infection of her sternum.  I will send her to Trevino made to for the surgical team to violate this, and will then a CT scan of her chest and sternum looking for any collection of pus.\n\n\n\nI have encouraged her to continue to be active.  Her walking is limited by pain, which limits or exercise.  She has already returned to her part-time work.\n\n\n\nI made no change in her regimen today.  Our plan to see her again a couple of months and she will continue on Coumadin anticoagulation.  I'll keep you posted.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSincerely yours,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWilliam C.

OBRYAN, M.D.\n \nVALLEJO GENERAL HOSPITAL\nENDOCRINOLOGY DIVISION                        Workman, Edwin\n534 Lunar Lane                           61248040\nBrookshire, MO  15345                             4-12-84\n \n \nReferring Physician:  Dr. Kenyon, Dr. Elmer Ure, Vallejo General \nCardiology.  \n \nReferring Diagnosis: Status post cardiac transplant. Rule out \nosteoporosis.  \n \nHPI:  Patient is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of lymphoma, \ndiagnosed in 2070 when he presented with left axillary enlargement.  At \nthe time, he was staged by bone marrow transplant which was negative.  \nWhether this was a Hodgkin's or non-Hodgki's lymphoma is unclear to us, \nbut he was treated with bleomycin, adriamycin and prednisone for \napproximately 26 weeks.  At that point, he was believed to be in \nremission and stayed in remission since then.  \n \nIn 2077, the patient was first diagnosed with diabetes mellitus when he \npresented with polyuria, polydipsia and blurred vision.  Subsequently he \nwas treated with oral hypoglycemic agents for one to two years and since \nthat time has been on insulin therapy, currently on 64 units of NPH and \nsix of regular in the morning with 30 NPH and six of regular pre-supper.  \nHe currently checks his blood sugars four times a day and runs in the \n100-200 range with average being about 130 and is followed by Dr. Nicodemus \nPaz of Queenstown, WI, his primary care doctor, for this.  The patient's \ncomplications of diabetes mellitus are possibly non-existent.  There is \nno peripheral neuropathy.  There is no autonomic neuropathy.  No retinal \ndisease.  However, the patient does have renal disease, with baseline \ncreatinine currently of 2.4.  \n \nRecently the patient developed congestive heart failure with initial \nsymptoms in the early 80s.  By June of 2082, the patient had fairly \nsevere symptoms requiring hospitalizations and in the period of July \n2082 to June of 2083, the patient apparently had 5 myocardial \ninfarctions.  In June 2083, the patient underwent orthotopic cardiac \ntransplant here at the VGH under the care of Dr. Quentin Fitzpatrick.  Since \nthat time, the patient has done very well without evidence of rejection \nwith relatively good exercise tolerance and with basically a minimum \ndegree of symptoms.  \n \nThe patient's current medications include cyclosporine 150 mg. twice a \nday; prednisone 8 mg. a day.  Azathioprine 250 mg. a day; Axid 150 mg. \ntwice a day; Cardizem 300 mg. a day; baby aspirin once a day; Cardura 4 \nmg. once a day; and amitriptyline 25 mg. a day for cramping in his legs.  \n \nReview of Systems:  Has had one fracture of his right ring finger that \nwas from a trauma some years ago.  Other past medical history includes \nhistory of sleep apnea and depression and the things mentioned.  \n \nRACHAEL G. OBRYAN, M.D.\n \nVALLEJO GENERAL HOSPITAL\nENDOCRINOLOGY DIVISION                        Workman, Edwin\n179 Lunar Lane                           61248040\nBrookshire, MO  15345                             4-12-84\nPage 2\n \n \nFamily History:  His sister, aged 54, and mother, have osteoporosis with \nhis mother having fairly severe osteoporosis with a normal of vertebral \ncollapses and some nerve damage.  His father and mother have had \ndiabetes mellitus, his father dying of heart disease.  There is a \n19-year-old daughter who has a history of migraines.  There is no \nhistory of thyroid disease in the family.\n \nSocial History:  He currently works at Belkin and has a desk job \nthere.  He quit smoking and drinking 15-20 years ago.  He has been \nmarried for over 20 years.  His review of symptoms revealed the absence \nof GI symptoms.  There were no orthostatic symptoms, no angina.  Normal \nsexual function.  He denied any skin problems or rashes.  He denied \nnumbness and tingling in his feet, etc.  There is a history of \nhypertension.  \n \nOther review of systems:  His height has been stable at 6'2\" tall.  \n \nPhysical Examination:  Blood pressure 130/93.  Heart rate 96.   The \npatient is a well-appearing gentleman, somewhat obese.  His height is \n6'2\".  Weight 294 lbs. which is apparently steadily been increasing.  He \nhas a mild Cushingoid appearance with a little bit of posterior cervical \nand supraclavicular fat.  Retina appeared without lesions.  Normal \nextra-ocular movements.  His oral mucosa was moist without evidence of \nthrush.  Neck exam:  He had a supple neck with no carotid bruits.  \nNormal thyroid.   His chest exam revealed clear lung fields with normal \nexcretion.  There was no bony tenderness or abnormalities on his back.  \nHis cardiac exam:  He had a soft, S1, S2.  Cardiac exam otherwise \nunremarkable.  His abdomen was soft.  He had some evidence of insulin \ninjections, but no significant hypertrophy.  He injects both in his \nabdomen and rotates with his arms.  His extremities revealed minimal \nstasis dermatitis, normal pulses, and were symmetric.  No edema.  \nNeurologically he was diffusely hyporeflexic.  He had normal to slightly \ndecreased vibratory sensation in his big toes.  \n \nLaboratory Exam:  Most recent laboratories that I could find were \nFebruary 09, 2084.  Sodium 141.  K 5.1; chloride 105.  Bicarb 20.  BUN \n39.  Creatinine 3.4; glucose 136.  His CK was 219.  Calcium 9.7.  \nAlbumin 4.3; phosphate 4.0.  Alkaline phosphatase was 90.  Uric acid \n5.1; magnesium 1.9.  TSH was 1.6.  Cholesterol 242.  Triglycerides 226.  \nHis cyclosporine level was in the therapeutic range at 273.  His CBC \nrevealed a hematocrit of 43 and a white count of 8.9 thousand with a \nnormal differential.  \n \nAssessment and Plan:  This is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of \nmultiple medical problems.  The one's most pertinent to us currently are \nRACHAEL G. OBRYAN, M.D.\n \nVALLEJO GENERAL HOSPITAL\nENDOCRINOLOGY DIVISION                        Workman, Edwin\n007 Lunar Lane                           61248040\nBrookshire, MO  15345                             4-12-84\nPage 3\n \n \nthe fact that he is post-transplant, has several risk factors for \nosteoporosis, including prednisone use and a family history of \nosteoporosis.  The total amount of exposure to prednisone sounds like it \nis about a year-and-a-half or so with half a year during his \nchemotherapy 14 years ago and then about a year since his transplant.  \nThe patient's history of never having had fractures, no bone pain, no \nheight loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might \nbe somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant \npatients.  However, getting a bone density study in the patient like \nthis makes sense.  We will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on \nhis follow up visit, since he cannot have one today for scheduling \nreasons.  We will also check vitamin D levels given patient's history of \nrenal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to \ndo for him is to give him vitamin D.  His calcium intake was estimated \nto be about 1,000 mg. a day including one cup of milk, green leafy \nvegetables and one cup of ice cream each day.  We would be a little \nreticent about starting higher doses of calcium given his renal failure, \nwithout more information about this patient.  The patient's diabetes \nseems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugars under \nfairly good control, sounding like they are in the 130 range although we \ndon't have access to hemoglobin A1C.  Given the fact that it sounds like \nhe has got pretty good care by Dr. Paz, we will not pursue this at \nthe current time unless asked, and we will focus primarily on the bone \nsituation.  Otherwise, we will see the patient back or at least talk to \nRACHAEL G.

Paz, M.D.\n5 Fox Meadow Road\nHebron,  WI  31155\n \nRE:  Edwin Workman\n     MR #612-48-04-0\n \nDear Dr. Paz:\n \nI had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Workman in follow-up today. \nOverall, he is doing very well from a cardiovascular perspective. \nUnfortunately, he continues to gain weight but overall he is doing\nwell. \n \nHis current medical regimen includes cyclosporin 150 b.i.d.,\nprednisone 6 mg q.d., Imuran 275 q.d., Cardizem CD 300 mg q.d.,\nCardura 4 mg q.d., one baby aspirin a day, Axid 150 b.i.d.,\npravachol 20 q.d., magnesium oxide 250 mg b.i.d., calcium and\nvitamin D, insulin NPH 54 units and 10 Regular in the morning, 32\nunits of NPH and 8 of Regular in the evening.  \n \nOn physical examination, he was obese.  Blood pressure of 150/90\nwith a heart rate of 85, weight was 305 pounds which is increased\n5 pounds from September 21st.  Chest was clear to auscultation and\npercussion.  Cardiac exam reveals a flat JVP at 30 degrees, a non-\ndisplaced PMI with a normal S1, S2 without murmurs, rubs or\ngallops.  Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.  His abdomen\nis obese, soft and nontender.  It is difficult to appreciate any\norganomegaly.  There is no hepatojugular reflux.  Extremities are\nwithout edema. \n \nElectrocardiogram reveals normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 85. \nIntervals of .16/.08/.34 with an axis of 60 degrees.  This is a\nnormal tracing unchanged from previous tracing.\n \nTherefore, Mr. Workman is doing well from a cardiovascular\nperspective.  We will make the necessary adjustments in his medical\nregimen according to his laboratory results.  Unfortunately, he did\ntake his cyclosporin this morning and therefore he will mail his\nlabs back to us.\n \nI did discuss with him attempting some weight loss with portion\ncontrol.  I think it might work to give him some reasonable goals\nsuch as a weight loss of 30 pounds as apposed to 130.\n \nWorkman, Edwin\nMR #612-48-04-0                    -2-            October 17, 2085\n \nMr. Workman will return in January for a biopsy and clinic visit.  \nBest regards.\n \nSincerely,\n \n \n \nElmer Knott, M.D.\nVallejo General Hospital\n39 Lacy Street\nBrookshire,  MO  15345\n \nDD: 10/17/85\nDT: 10/18/85\nDV: 10/17/85\n \n/ingalls\n \n ******** Approved but not reviewed by Attending Provider ********\n\n\n\n\n",

Most\nimportantly, recently he was laid off from his job at Belkin.  He\nhas been quite depressed about this.  \n \nHis medical regimen includes Cyclosporin 150 b.i.d., prednisone 6\nq.d., Imuran 275 q.d., Cardizem CD 300 q.d., Cardura 4 mg. q.d.,\nPravachol 40 mg. q.d., Axid 150 b.i.d., Calcium, vitamin C and D,\nMag. Oxide 250 q.d., Paxil 300 q.d., NPH Insulin.\n \nOn physical examination he was well appearing in no distress.  He\nhad a blood pressure of 136/80 with a heart rate of 90, weight was\n309 pounds which has increased eight pounds from July.  Chest was\nclear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam revealed a flat JVP at 30\ndegrees, non-displaced PMI with a normal S1 and S2 without murmurs,\nrubs or gallops.  Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.\nAbdomen was soft, nontender. There is no organomegaly, no\nhepatojugular reflux. Extremities without edema.\n \nElectrocardiogram reveals normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 90. \nIntervals of .16/.08/.33 with an axis of 70 degrees. This is a\nnormal tracing and unchanged from his previous tracing on 9/20/86.Edwin Workman\n#612-48-04-0                  - 2 -          November 09, 2086\n \nTherefore, Mr. Workman is stable at this time from a cardiac\nperspective.  We will make the necessary adjustments in his medical\nregimen according to his laboratory results.\n \nBest regards.\n \nSincerely,\n \n \n \nElmer Knott, M.D.\n \n/ismail\n \nDD: 11/09/86\nDT: 11/11/86\nDV: 11/09/86\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\n\n\n\n",

He is CP free and stable and is being transferred for further evaluation and work up.  Last HD session on Tuesday. \n\n\nLast dobutamine echo last year showed some LV apex hypokinesis, which augments in response dobutamine. \n\n\nECG revealed NSR at 82 w/ poor R wave progression on anterior leads. Qwave on AvL but no new TWI or ST changes. \n\n\nEcho at OSH reveiled lower EF at 30-35% with HK on anteroseptal, mid anterior, apical lateral and apical inferior walls segments. \n\n\nHe reports chronic dypsnea on moderate exertion. He is quite sedentary. \n\n\nROS: preserved appetite. \n\n\nPMH: CAD, obesity, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea wears cpap at night, ESRD hemodialysis dependent, depression and GERD.  \n\n\nHis current medications include aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily, Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d., Cardizem CD 360 mg p.o. daily, Effexor 125 mg p.o. daily, , Lantus 120 units subcutaneously b.i.d., Lasix 60 m p.o. BID nonHD days, lexapro 10 mg p.o. daily, Lipitor 10 mg p.o. daily, cyclosporine 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.,  Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. daily, vitamin C 500 mg p.o. b.i.d., and vitamin E 400 international units p.o. b.i.d.\n\n\nAll: pravastatin\n\n\nSH: lives w/ wife. Ex-smoker\n\n\nFH: positive for DM and CAD\n\n\nPE:  96.3  130/74  16 100% 2l\nNAD, JVP flat\nRRR distant HS\nCTA b/l\nAbd obese, soft, NT, ND\nL forearm AVF w/ good thrill and bruit\nLE no edema\n\n\nLABS\npending\n\n\nIMPRESSION\n61 yo M s/p heart transplant and ESRD on HD presenting with elevated troponin. The trend of his creatinine from outside hospital is not suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. Troponin leak is a common finding in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis since the hemodynamic changes lead to subendocardial ischemia during short-time ultrafiltration. On the other hand, due to the difficulty in evaluating ACS in patients that had undergone transplant, will repeat cardiac markers for the next 12 hours and meanwhile, continue medical management with ASA, statin, BB and heparin. The lower EF on outside echo could suggest as well recent past event of myocardial infarction, especially with the multiple walls demonstrating hypokinesis. \n&gt; Continue other home meds.\n&gt; Check CSA level in am.\n&gt; Since stable volume status, consider contacting renal in am for further decision about next HD session depending on lab results. \n&gt; Will continue lasix on nonHD days. \n&gt; Will defer further testing to primary cardiologist in am.\n&gt; CPAP at night\n&gt; Keep NPO after MN. \n&gt; Will check PTH, iron store, Ca/PO4 and 25 vitD. \n\n\n_________________\nHenry Norris, MD\n    \n\n\n\n",

As you are aware he is a 56 year old man who is a convenience store manager.  He has had a lot of trouble with his right knee over the years, \n\nmainly related to sports injuries.\n\n \n\nHe has had in particular 2 years of pain now in his right knee.  It got so \n\nbad 6 months ago that he required large amounts of ibuprofen to relieve that. \n\n \n\nIt has slowly got better since then.  \n\n \n\nAt present his main problem is pain in the knee which mainly occurs with \n\nactivity but he also has rest and night pain.  He has a restricted walking \n\ndistance.\n\n \n\nWith regard to function, he is able to carry out his work with difficulty and \n\nrequires periods of rest in the evening on returning home from work.  He has \n\nnoticed his knee is becoming slowly more bowed.  \n\n \n\nWith regard to treatment he has is taking regular analgesia in the form of \n\nTylenol but has recently noticed blood in his stool for which he is going to \n\nhave a colonoscopy in the near future.  \n\n \n\nHe has not tried any canes and has not had any physical therapy as yet.\n\n \n\nOn examination I note he has bilateral varus knees, worse on the right than \n\nthe left.  He has an antalgic gait and marked varus thrust.  \n\n \n\nHe has a marked effusion that does not have any gross swelling indicative of \n\narthritis.  He has a 5 degree fixed flexion deformity and flexes up to 115 \n\ndegrees.  His varus deformity is not fully correctable.  He has grade 5 \n\nquadriceps power.  \n\n \n\nX-rays reveal marked degenerative changes in his right knee with complete \n\nobliteration of joint space on the right side.  \n\n \n\nI note he also has changes in his left knee indicative of medial compartment \n\narthritis but his left knee is currently asymptomatic.  \n\n \n\nWe have discussed the operative options for him which consist of high tibial \n\nosteotomy, a unicompartmental knee replacement, and a total knee replacement. \n\n \n\nAt present neither he not Dr. Oates feels that his symptoms are severe \n\nenough to warrant operative intervention.  We would certainly reconsider \n\nshould he run into trouble in the next few months aspirating his knee, \n\ninstilling some corticosteroids.  We have advised him that this will only \n\nprovide him with short term relief but may allow him enough relief to begin \n\nsome walking and fitness in an attempt to lose some weight.\n\n \n\nWe have organized to see him again in 4-6 month's time at which stage we will \n\nreassess him.  Should he run into trouble in the meantime he cal certainly \n\nring up and make an appointment to come and see us and we will aspirate the \n\nknee and instill some corticosteroid.  \n\n \n\nWith kind regards.  \n\n \n\nYours sincerely, \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n_______________________________\n\nOliver M.

He has known complication of retinopathy and is status post bilateral laser surgery about one year ago.  He has no known neuropathy or nephropathy.  He has no known history of CAD, CVA or PVD.  He had previously been followed by Dr. Elizabeth Keys at Pioneer Hospital at Findlay until June of this year which time he switched to a new primary care doctor.  At that time, he had been on glyburide, metformin and Avandia, his new PCP increased his glyburide and his Avandia.  He also stopped his hydrochlorothiazide out of concern that this is not an ideal agent for a diabetic patient. Over the next weeks to months, the patient had progressive peripheral edema, fluid weight gain and ultimately development of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  He returned for care and was started on furosemide and has been recently titrated up to a dose of 60 mg orally on this.  He self adjusted his Avandia dose from 4 mg twice daily to 2 mg daily.  His prebreakfast blood glucose has been elevated ranging from 160-200.  He has had some resolution of his fluid overload with the Lasix and lower dose Avandia.  He says he has persistent feeling of swelling and tightness in his fingers and toes with episodic ankle swelling as well.  He denies chest pain, claudication polyuria, polydipsia.  He has been losing weight since starting Lasix.  He has never had hypoglycemia.\n\n\n\nDIABETES SURVELLIANCE AND MANAGEMENT:\n\nHemoglobin A1c 11.4% (10/01/84).\n\nCholesterol 190, LDL cholesterol 190, HDL 49 (10/01/84) and LDL 118 (07/02/84).\n\nMicroalbumin to creatinine 19 (07/02/84).\n\nCreatinine 0.9 (07/02/84).\n\nLast eye exam 09/83.\n\nPneumovax never.\n\nInfluenza vaccine never.\n\nAspirin 325 mg daily.\n\nACE inhibitor yes (lisinopril 10 mg daily,).\n\nStatin yes (Lipitor 40 mg daily).\n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n\nDiabetes as above.\n\nDiabetic retinopathy.\n\nHypertension.\n\nOsteoarthritis of the knees.\n\nStatus post hammertoe repair.\n\nPilonidal cyst status post I&D.\n\nSevered Achilles tendon status post repair.\n\nRight meniscus removal.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS: Glyburide 10 mg twice daily, metformin 1000 mg twice daily and the Avandia 2 mg daily, Lipitor 40 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily.  furosemide 60 mg daily, multivitamin one tablet daily and Viagra as needed.\n\n\n\nALLERGIES:  Amoxicillin gives him a rash.\n\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\n\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He works as a manager in a convenience store, he lives with his wife.  He has no kids.  He does not exercise secondary to joint pain.  He tends to eat a lot of carbohydrates and meats although he does not have a sweet tooth.  He denies tobacco, alcohol or recreational drug use.  \n\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per HPI, otherwise, negative.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His weight is 270 pounds, his blood pressure is 150/92 and then 155/92 to my a repeat exam, pulse is 70 and regular.  In general, he is a well-appearing gentleman in no acute distress.  His skin is warm and dry.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx is clear.  Mucous membranes are moist.  He has no carotid bruits.  His thyroid is normal in size and contour.  Lung exam reveals crackles at the bases.  His heart is regular in rate and rhythm with an S1, S2, without S3 or S4.  Abdomen is obese, soft and nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  His extremities are without clubbing or cyanosis.  There is 2+ pitting edema to the ankles.  His foot exam reveals that his distal pulses are okay.  Sensation is intact to monofilament.  There is no skin breakdown or ulcerations.  He has an extensive onychomycosis of the nails bilaterally.\n\n\n\nGlucose 132.\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 61-year-old gentleman with type II diabetes complicated by retinopathy and erectile dysfunction.  He has had inadequate glycemic control on oral agents which are currently at their maximal doses given the intolerable side effects of Avandia.  He has plans for elective knee replacement during the spring and we have advised him that before he consider that he should get his diabetes under better control, should make sure his blood pressure is controlled and should seek cardiac evaluation, especially given his history of pulmonary edema symptoms on Avandia.\n\n\n\n1.  We will start insulin today initially NPH 25 units at bedtime to replace his evening dose of glyburide.  We have instructed him on use of the Inolet for insulin administration.  He will continue his glyburide 10 mg each morning, continue metformin 1000 mg twice daily and Avandia 2 mg each morning.  We will check hemoglobin A1c today as a baseline. We will follow up to determine appropriate titration of his insulin as well as addition of other doses during the day.\n\n2.  His blood pressure is not optimally controlled at this time.  We will increase his lisinopril to 40 mg daily. He will continue his furosemide 60 mg daily and he will continue to titrate his Lasix dosing at the guidance of his primary care doctor.\n\n3.  His last microalbumin to creatinine ratio and creatinine were normal.  Testing is up-to-date.\n\n4.  The patient has an LDL that was above target this summer and Lipitor was initiated; however, he has not been on this long enough to see an effect. At his next visit, we will reevaluate his lipids to determine if his Lipitor needs titration.\n\n5.  He is overdue for an eye exam and will contact Dr. Xuereb at Findlay him to have this done.\n\n6.  We have made a referral to Dr. Liam Mcmahon for cardiology evaluation.  We have ordered an echocardiogram to be performed prior to this visit. We have also referred the patient to a number of possible PCPs in the OMC/CBC system. \n\n\n\nThe patient was advised to return to the office in two months for follow up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nFlorence Mildred Yuan, MD\n\n\n\n\n\nDictated By: Florence Mildred Yuan\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:2-8940866 EMSSten Tel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 12/16/84\n\nDT: 12/16/84\n\nDV: 12/12/84\n\n\n\n",

I will be sending a copy of this letter to\nDr. Oliver Oates as evaluation for preop assessment as well.\n\nMr. Fair is a 61-year-old male who has a number of risk factors for coronary artery disease but is unaware of any known prior manifestations.  He has had diabetes mellitus for about 20 years.  About two months ago, he started on insulin, and he is now followed by you at the Endocrine Group.  His most recent glucose had been in the range of 86 with his lipids including total cholesterol of 157, triglycerides 103, HDL of 42, and LDL of 94.  His current medical regimen for these and his other problems include insulin NPH 10 units in the morning, 25 units in the afternoon, glyburide 20 mg q.d., and metformin 1000 mg q.d..  He also takes Lasix 60 mg per day, lisinopril 40 mg per day, and Lipitor 10 mg q.d.\n\nHis other risk factors are notable for hypertension, which has been labile and borderline high in the past.  He is currently on the lisinopril with apparently good control of his pressure.  He has had hypercholesterolemia and is now doing well on Lipitor.  He does not smoke cigarettes, but he is obese.\n\nHe has no known history of MI, angina, or shortness of breath.\n\nHis other risk is notable for his family history, which includes his father who died at the age of 72 of an MI as well as leukemia.  His mother died at the age of 74 of mesothelioma, and he has two sisters and one brother who are well.\n\nHe had an echo performed on February 2, 2085, in anticipation of his knee surgery in March 2085, and this was notable for a mildly dilated left ventricle with mild concentric LVH.  Overall LV function is mildly-to-moderately reduced with an estimated ejection fraction of 40%.  The entire inferior and posterior walls were akinetic and thin consistent with myocardial scar.  The apical anterior wall, apical lateral wall, and left ventricular apex were hypokinetic suggestive of myocardial hibernation or scar.  The right ventricle was normal in size and function, the left atrium was mildly dilated, the aortic valve was unremarkable, the mitral valve was slightly thickened with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, and the tricuspid valve was structurally normal.\n\nHis past medical history is notable for kidney stones, which he has had over the past 10 years or so.  He has had three or four attacks, the most recent one was two years ago.\nHe also has the severe osteoarthritis of the lower extremities predominantly affecting the knees.  Both Achilles tendons have been damaged as well apparently.  He is anticipating knee replacement with Dr. Oates on March 23, 2085.\n\nSocial history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.  He has a convenience store and frequently eats out of it throughout the day with poor dietary habits.\n\nHis review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.\n\nOn exam, he is obese but comfortable.  Blood pressure is 150/80, heart rate of 67 and regular, and weight of 278 pounds.  Head and neck are unremarkable.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.  There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.  Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.  The abdomen is obese.  Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.  Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.  Distal pulses are normal.\n\nHis resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with evidence of previous inferior MI and poor R-wave progression, V1 through V3.  He has a superior axis likely related to the inferior MI.  The QRS is increased with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.\n\nMr. Fair clearly has evidence of coronary artery disease with at least one myocardial infarction.  This had been entirely asymptomatic and was quite a shock for Mr. Fair to hear this information.  We will obtain an adenosine MIBI scan prior to his surgery to be sure we have a better idea of the status of his myocardial perfusion.  In addition, I strongly encouraged him to lose as much weight as possible.  He seems both very interested in losing weight but at the same time somewhat cavalier an overly confident that he will be able to do so.  I think the most important thing is going to be dietary management, since I doubt he will ever be able to do enough physical activity to burn sufficient calories to lose weight on that basis alone.  We will check his Chem-25 today as well as CRP, and I will review these results with him as soon as they are available.\nI also asked him to check on his blood pressure at home and let me know the results.\nIf any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.  We will hopefully be able to identify his preop risk factor status with his perfusion scan within the next week.  Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.\n\nKindest personal regards.\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nLiam Mcmahon, MD\n\n\nDictated By: Liam Mcmahon\n\n\neScription document:6-8059879 SFFocus\n\n\nCC: Oliver Oates M.D.\nOsteopathic Medical Center\n73 Weymouth Dr\nPlymouth, IN 46368\n\nDD: 02/18/85\nDT: 02/18/85\nDV: 02/18/85\n\n\n\n",

Mcmahon, MD\n\nDivision of Cardiology\n\nOsteopathic Medical Center\n\n\n\nRe:\tBill FAIR\n\n\tOMC 220-41-86-4\n\n\n\nDear Dr. Mcmahon:\n\n\n\nI had the pleasure of caring for Mr. Fair at OMC 03/20-21/05.  He is a 61-year-old man with CAD, DM, high cholesterol, HTN, and family history of early CAD, who had a stress test that showed peri-infarct ischemia in the left circumflex and PDA.  Angiography showed a codominant system, a 100 percent left circumflex occlusion, an 85 percent RC lesion, and nonobstructive LAD lesions.  The left circumflex was recanalized and a Taxus 2.5mm by 32mm stent was placed.  The procedure was done with Angiomax and the sheath was pulled manually.  There were no complications.\n\n\n\nHe spent an uneventful evening without complaints or complications, ambulating without difficulty.  His groin was soft and tender with ecchymosis but no hematoma.  Extremities were warm with 1+ edema to the ankles; pulses were 2+ throughout.  Morning labs included cholesterol of 114, triglycerides 109, HDL 34 and LDL 58.  He was discharged home on NPH insulin; Mucomyst, 600mg bid; aspirin, 325mg qd; atenolol, 25mg qd; Lasix, 60mg qd; glyburide, 10mg qd; lisinopril, 40mg qd; Lipitor, 40mg qd; Diovan, 80mg qd; Plavix, 75mg qd; metformin, 500mg bid to be restarted on 03/23/85; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.  He will require aspirin for life and Plavix for six months; he will not stop either medication unless told to do so by you.  His HDL is low and given his degree of atherosclerosis, you may wish to start gemfibrozil or Niaspan.  He will see you in follow-up in the next two weeks.  Thank you for allowing us to share in his care.  Please call if you have questions.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRodger Lester, MD\n\nRL/ferreira\n\ncc:\tUriel Lim, MD, 2192 Manatee Street, Plymouth, IN 74489\n\nDS:   03/21/85\n\nDD:   03/21/85\n\nDT:   03/25/85\n\n     \n\n\n\n",

He was in his usual state of health when one week PTA he decided to abruptly discontinue his Fentanyl patch, which he had for three years at 75mg for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy and gastroparesis. He recently decided he no longer wanted to wear the patch because he was concerned about personality changes and side effects of the medication. His PCP instructed him to taper the medication, switching him to a 50 mg patch, but Mr. Kaufman removed the patch without a taper. \n\nHe felt fine for a few days, but began to experience pain in his feet, LE edema, insomnia and rhinorrhea.  On the day of admission, he was watching television when he experienced the acute onset of shortness of breath and chest tightness. He described the chest tightness as    like someone sitting on    his R chest below his shoulder, with a band-like distribution across his upper chest, intermittent, non-radiating and somewhat relieved by moving his R shoulder.  This pain lasted 4-5 minutes but his shortness of breath persisted. The shortness of breath was worse with exertion, not improved with rest and caused his to take rapid shallow breaths. He also began to have a non-productive cough this same day. This was the first time he has ever experienced this chest discomfort and shortness of breath. He denies nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, acid reflux sensation, PND, orthopnea, fever or sick contacts.\n\n\n\nED Course:  \n\nVitals: T: 97.9  BP:  195/115  HR: 84  RR: 28  Sat:  95-96% on RA\n\nInterventions: \n\n\t1.5-2.0L NS\n\n\tKayexcelate 45mg PO\n\n\tASA 325mg\n\n\tNorvasc 5mg PO\n\n\tNexium 40mg PO\n\n\tToprol 100mg PO\n\n\tLopressor 5mg IV\n\n\tMorphine sulfate 1mg IV\n\n\tMSO4 1mg IV\n\nStudies:\n\n\tK+=5.6  (9/06/62 5:02AM)\n\n\tEKG: see Data section\n\n\tCXR: see Data section\n\n\n\nPast Medical/Surgical History:\n\nDiabetes Mellitus: dx 18 years ago, used Insulin in past, has only used for 1-2 weeks in \n\npast year, last HgbA1c 5.4 (8/17/62), complications include peripheral neuropathy, retinal disease, gastroparesis and numerous LE ulcers\n\nHypertension: initially labeled as    labile hypertension   , SBP's often in 190's-200's, on \n\nmultiple medical regimens in past\n\nChronic renal failure: creatinine >1.5 starting in 9/61\n\nHepatitis C: viral load >1,000,000 in 2/22, thought to be acquired through sexual contact, \n\ndenies IV drug use\n\n\n\nAllergies:\n\nReglan- dystonia\n\n\n\nMedications: \n\nHCTZ 25mg PO QD\n\nLisinopril 20mg PO QD\n\nToprol XL 100mg PO QD\n\nNorvasc 5mg PO BID\n\nNeurontin 600mg PO QD\n\nProtonix 40 mg PO QD\n\nInsulin ?

His initial cardiac markers were positive, but are hard to interpret as a sign of ischemia in the setting of renal failure. He has clinical evidence of pulmonary edema and findings on CXR suggestive of interstitial edema. However, his JVP was not elevated and he only presented with mild LE edema.  His symptoms of shortness of breath are consistent with left-sided heart failure, possibly caused by an ischemic event. His acute renal failure has multiple possible etiologies (some of which could occur concurrently) including CHF, drug toxicity (lisinopril and NSAIDs), DM-associated nephropathy, chronic hypertension and renal artery stenosis.\n\n\n\nProblem List and Plan:\n\nSOB/Chest tightness:\n\n\t--continue to cycle enzymes for R/O\n\n-CXR AP and lateral to assess presence of pulmonary edema\n\n\t-TTE\n\n\t-diuresis with Lasix 20mg IV\n\n\t-Hydralazine 10mg QID & Isosorbide dinitrate 5mg PO TID \n\n\t-d/c Lisinopril\n\n-continue O2 at 2L, monitor O2 sat\n\n\t-monitor ins and outs, daily weights\n\n\t-obtain lipid panel to assess CAD risk factors and need for statin\n\nRenal failure: acute over chronic, baseline nephropathy due to DM and HTN, history of \n\n+protein in urine, urine sediment spun, no signs of active sediment \n\n-urinary electrolytes to measure FENa\n\n-d/c Lisinopril\n\n-dose Neurontin according to renal function\n\n-consider ruling out renal artery stenosis\n\n-obtain urinary eosinophils to evaluate for interstitial nephritis\n\nHypertension: hypertensive emergency considered, but determined to be unlikely due to \n\nchronity of elevated SBP at similar values, under treatment\n\n\t-continue Toprol XL 100mg QD, Norvasc 5mg BID\n\n-add Hydralazine 10mg QID, Isosorbide dinitrate 5mg PO TID\n\n-monitor BP and signs and symptoms of target organ damage closely\n\nOpioid withdrawal/pain management:\n\n\t-Morphine PRN\n\n\t-consult pain service\n\nDM:\n\n\t-sliding scale insulin\n\n\t-obtain Insulin and C peptide levels because unclear if currently taking Insulin\n\nProphylaxis:\n\n\t-20mg Nexium PO QD\n\n\t-Heparin 5000 units SC BID\n\n                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t___________________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t           Udo O.

Previously had blood sugars as high as 400 to 600 and would not take any medications.  Diabetes complicated by peripheral neuropathy, which is severe; gastroparesis, which has been severe; recurrent skin abscesses; and probable coronary artery disease.\n\nHypertension\n\nThis has been also severe for many years and noncompliance is a significant issue.  Now complicated also by significant orthostatic hypotension presumably on the basis of autonomic insufficiency.\n\nCoronary artery disease\n\nHe is status post recent non Q wave MI with elevated troponins presenting with congestive heart failure and chest pain in the setting of an elevated creatinine.\n\nChronic renal insufficiency\n\nCreatinine approximately 3.\n\nPyelonephritis HISTORY OF\n\n\n\nAnemia\n\nChronic.    Extensive workup negative.\n\nSinus tachycardia\n\nChronic.  This has been present for many years.  Etiology unclear.  Recent stress test does not show evidence of more complicated arrhythmia.  Cardiac ultrasound was done on his recent admission, and he has an ejection fraction of 63% with no significant valvular disease.  He has symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\nMigraine headache HISTORY OF\n\n\n\nHepatitis C\n\nChronic.\n\n\n\nAllergies\n\nNo known allergies   \n\n\n\nChange in therapies and Renewals\n\nsenna 2 teaspoons  BID\n\naspirin 325 mg  qd\n\nhydralazine 25 mg  TID\n\nImdur 30 mg  QD\n\nLasix 20 mg  qd\n\nNexium 20 mg  qd\n\nNorvasc 5 mg  BID\n\nNeurontin 100 mg  TID\n\nlabetalol HCl 100 mg  BID\n\nlosartan 25 mg  qd\n\nerythromycin 250 mg  TID\n\nEpogen 3000 units sq qwk\n\nColace 100 mg  BID\n\n\n\nFamily history   Notable for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.\n\n\n\nSocial history   He was previously the head statistical programmer for electronic data systems for many years and now disabled.  He is married and has a daughter.  Cigarettes, none times years.  Alcohol, previously heavy.  There was a history of previous illicit drug use.\n\n\n\nReview of systems   Since he has been home, he has done reasonably well though he has noted increasing leg edema bilaterally with a significant weight gain.  He denies chest pain or palpitations.  He denies shortness of breath.  He has not been vomiting, and he actually self-discontinued both OxyContin and methadone because he felt that they did not make him feel well.\n\n\n\nPhysical examination\n\nPulse   86 per minute\n\nBlood pressure 150/90    Today, 150/90 then 144/86\n\nWeight   185 pounds\n\nHeent   Eyes, ears, nose, and pharynx are normal, but dentition is poor\n\nNeck   No bruits\n\nNodes   None palpable\n\nChest   Lungs, clear\n\nCor   Regular rate and rhythm without murmur\n\nAbdomen   Benign\n\nExtrem   With 3+ massive edema\n\nNeuro   Abnormal gait due to peripheral neuropathy\n\n\n\nAssessment and plan   Leg edema is uncertainly due to his vasodilators.  We will discontinue hydralazine and Norvasc.  He has already stopped his OxyContin and methadone.  We will see him back in approximately two weeks to follow up on his blood pressure.  He will have routine laboratory studies done today.\n\n\n\nNote transcribed by outside service   Transcription errors may be present.\n\n\n\nSigned electronically by Patrick I Yeates MD on Oct 1, 2062     \n\n\n\n",

There is no evidence of a\n\n\tflap within the aorta to suggest a dissection. The takeoffs of the\n\n\tgreat vessels are normally patent. There is no evidence of\n\n\taneurysm.\n\n\tThe celiac artery and SMA are patent. There are single renal\n\n\tarteries bilaterally.  There is mild narrowing of the proximal\n\n\tright renal artery.  The left renal artery is patent.\n\n\t\n\n\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n\tUnremarkable MRA of the thoracic aorta, without evidence of\n\n\tdissection or aneurysm.\n\n\tMild narrowing of the proximal right renal artery.\n\n\t\n\n\t____________________________________________\n\n\n\nA/P:\tThis is a 70 year old man with acute shortness of breath and back pain. \n\n\n\n1.\t Cardiology - Will rule out for MI\n\nReceived ASA, SLNG, Lasix, beta-blocker in ED\n\nCardiac monitor, cycle enzymes\n\nOn atenolol, irbesartan as outpatient;  will continue hydralazine for better management.\t\n\n  \t2.\tRenal - cr 1.8, appears close to baseline, consistent with chronic renal insufficiency, likely due to hypertensive disease\n\nWill continue to follow\n\n  \t3.\tEndo - diabetic, non-insulin dependent\n\nSS insulin, will convert to NPH once daily requirement is clear\n\n  \t4.\tMusculoskeletal - history and present complaint of chronic back pain, low to mid-back\n\nPercocet for pain relief as NSAID contraindicated in CRI\n\n  \t5.\tPsych - volatile personality, significant anger toward doctors after wife's death 8 years ago\n\nWill attempt to minimize aggravating situations\n\n  \t6.\tFEN\n\nRepleted phosporus\n\n  \t7.\tProphylaxis\n\nAmbulating, on nexium.\n\n  \t8.\tDispo\n\nHome after acute cardiac workup complete; will have further risk stratification done through Shenandoah Hospital.\n\n  \t\n\n\n\n\t___________________________\n\n\tVera Winn  pager 12081\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Pt reports having markedly reduced right eye visual acuity this evening, subsequently became increasingly anxious and    nervous    and developed chest tightness across chest at level of xiphoid. Intermittently had sharp pains in same distribution, reaching 5/10 in severity. Associated nausea and dry heaving, only briefly SOB. No associated lightheadedness, diaphoresis, or palpitations. Called daughter who then called Shenandoah Hospital emergency line, then called MVH and came into their emergency room where he was referred to WMC ER secondary to chest discomfort. Symptoms had resolved by time of being seen in WMC ER. \n\n\n\nOf note, pt admitted to LMC (9/76) for acute onset SOB/CP. At that time, had negative PE protocol CT and adeno-MIBI. Just prior to that was admitted to WMC for similar symptoms and had negative dissection protocol CT at that time. At baseline, walks up to a mile without symptoms, also climbs stairs without symptoms. \n\n\n\nIn ER, vitals: T 98.2, P 69, BP 180/79, RR 18, 98% RA. Tx ASA 325mg, lopressor 25mg PO/5mg IV.

She was referred to us by Dr. Michael.  Ms. Yount has a history of diabetes mellitus for the last seven years.  She also has a long history of hypertension.  She retired from IBM in 2085 after working there for many years.  Her last posting was as a electrical mechanic.  She is feeling well.  She denies headaches, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  She also denies shortness of breath or complex partial seizures.  She denies swelling and presence of dysuria, fever, chills.  She is taking her medications regularly.  \n \nALLERGIES \nNo known drug allergies.  \n \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY \n1.  Diabetes mellitus for about seven years.  \n2.  Hypertension.  \n\n3.  PVD\n\n4.  Hypercholesterolemia\n\n \nSOCIAL HISTORY \nShe denies smoking or drinking.  She has one son living with her.\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY \nPositive for diabetes.  \n \nMEDICATIONS \nNorvasc 10 mg q. day,\n\nGlucophage 500 mg twice a day,\n\nGlucotrol 5 mg twice a day,\n\nAvandia 4 mg q. day, (she had incresed skin itching with attempts to increase the dose)\n\nLipitor 10 mg q. day,\n\nAspirin 325 mg a day (she is not taking aspirin).   \n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS \nMs. Yount denies any recent visual change, headaches.  She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, fever, chills.   \n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM \nMs. Yount looks well.  Blood pressure is 148/90.  Body weight is 188.  Repeat blood pressure is 170/80.  On examination of head and neck - no absolutely.  Thyroid is soft, nontender, no nodules.  Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.  Heart - regular rate and rhythm, no S3.  Abdomen is soft, bowel sounds present.  Extremities - trace edema.  \n \nLABORATORY \nPending.  \n \nIMPRESSION \nMs. Yount has diabetes and hypertension with a mildly elevated creatinine.  Her urine shows presence of protein, which suggests diabetic nephropathy.  Upon review of her medications, she is on a very good medication control, and  her blood pressure has been well controlled.  However, today the blood pressure is running higher.  I will see her in about two to three months.  If her blood pressure continues to be high, we should try to increase her dose of ARB.  I also explained to Ms. Yount the importance of taking aspirin and that she should continue her daily aspirin.   \n \n_______________________________ \nBrandon Vicente, M.D.  \n \nDD:03/08/2088 \nDT:03/10/2088 \nJM:99704     :137 \n \n\n\n\n\n",

She apparently had a fall, which caused substantial pain and some swelling, but no bruising.  Brought her in to have an evaluation.  X-rays showed no fracture and over the last few weeks things have improved substantially, and she comes in just because she was told to get it checked out by her doctors, but otherwise feeling quite good and wondering if the appointment is even necessary.  \n\n \n\nPast medical history includes high blood pressure and diabetes.  \n\n \n\nNo prior surgeries.  \n\n \n\nNo medications.  \n\n \n\nNo known drug allergies.  \n\n \n\nLists no family history of any problems.  \n\n \n\nLives alone and used to smoke, but quit.  \n\n \n\nOn examination, she has full range of motion of her wrist compared to the opposite side.  No atrophy, ecchymosis, edema or deformity.  Negative scaphoid shift test.  Slight tenderness over the distal radius.  Normal tendon function.  \n\n \n\nMy impression is that she must have got a mild sprain, which has recovered or possibly even a nondisplaced fracture given her age and osteoporotic bone, but whatever this was, it has resolved almost entirely, she is functioning well, and there is no apparent problem, so I will see her back as needed.   \n\n\n\n__________________________ \n\nYoel Newcomb, M.D.  \n\n \n\nCC:  Dustin T.

Th patient was well and normally active with walking and usual activities without DOE until 2 days ago. Last routine visit was in 9/91 w/ her PCP and was fine. 2 days ago noted DOE when going to store. This persisted w/ activity only. The patient was fine at rest and was able to sleep without difficulty. There were no recent changes in her meds. She had no other symptoms including CP, dizziness, URI symptoms, fever, chills, GI symptoms. No PND, orthopnea.\n\n\n\nShe previously had a cardiac evaluation during a similar presentation in 2085. She had a low level stress test and echocardiogram. No ischemia was demonstrated at a very minimal exertion. The echo showed LVH and an EF of 61%. Because of an impending snow storm, she decided to come to the hospital for evaluation. In the ED her BP was elevated and her 02 sat was only 78% on RA.\n\n\n\nPMH:\n\n1. Diabetes mellitus: on medical regimen, HgA1c 7.3 (9/91).\n\n\n\n2. Hypertension: Blood pressure is 140/72.  Echocardiogram 12/85 - EF 61%, LVH. ETT 12/85 - 4 METS, no wall motion abnormalities.\n\n\n\n3. Hypercholesterolemia: on Lipitor 10, LDL 78 (4/91).\n\n\n\n4. Peripheral vascular disease: arterial studies 10/90 - left SFA occlusion, and bilateral distal popliteal/ tibial\n\nvessel disease.  She is well collateralized across the ankles at rest and poorly collateralized across the ankles post exercise.  Perfusion is adequate to the TM level, and poor to the digital level, bilaterally\n\n\n\n5. Anemia: normocytic normochromic anemia with a normal SPEP and UPEP and iron studies. Baseline hematocrit of low 30's.\n\n\n\n6. Obesity. \n\n\n\n7. Osteopenia with a history of right radial fracture.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:\n\nTenormin 150mg po bid\n\nGlucotrol 5mg PO as directed 2 tab po qam, 1 tab po qpm Cozaar 100mg po QD\n\nhydrochlorothiazide 50mg po qd 1 tab po qd\n\nLipitor 10mg po QD\n\nNorvasc 10mg po qd\n\nGlucophage 1000 mg po bid take with meals\n\nAvandia 4 mg PO QD\n\nbuffered aspirin 325mg po qd\n\nvitamin d2 800 iu po qd\n\n\n\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergy.\n\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Lives in Glencoe. Has one son. Originally from Clearlake. Previously worked as a engineer at IBM research, retried a few yrs ago. Exercises twice a wk for 1/2 hour, aerobic exercises and treadmill at the gym.\n\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Father has DM. One sister diabetes father - diabetes. Sister - diabetes..\n\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative in detail except as otherwise noted.\n\n\n\nPE:\n\nGEN: WD, BF in NAD.\n\nVS: BP 115/53, HR 55 reg, temp 97.7, 02 sat 97% 2L, RR18\n\nHEENT: anicteric, oropharynx neg.\n\nNECK: supple, no JVD.\n\nCHEST: fine crackles 1/3 bilaterally, no dullness to percussion.\n\nCOR: reg, s1, s2 normal w/o s3, s4, m.\n\nABD: soft, NT, large, no mass.\n\nEXTR: no c/c/e, 2+ pulses.\n\nSKIN: no lesions noted.\n\nNEURO: A&Ox3, nonfocal.\n\n\n\nLABS ON ADMISSION:\n\n02/04/92 Sodium (Stat Lab) 128 L, \n\n02/04/92 Potassium (Stat Lab) 3.8, \n\n02/04/92 Chloride (Stat Lab) 96 L, \n\n02/04/92 CO2 (Stat Lab) 25.8, \n\n02/04/92 Transaminase-SGPT 18, \n\n02/04/92 Transaminase-SGOT 30, \n\n02/04/92 Alkaline Phosphatase 80, \n\n02/04/92 Total Bilirubin 0.7, \n\n02/04/92 Albumin 4.3, \n\n02/04/92 Creatine Kinase Isoenzymes NEGATIVE, \n\n02/04/92 Troponin-I NEGATIVE, \n\n02/04/92 BUN (Stat Lab) 27 H, \n\n02/04/92 Calcium 9.8, \n\n02/04/92 Creatinine (Stat Lab) 1.1, \n\n02/04/92 Glucose (Stat Lab) 200 H, \n\n02/04/92 Magnesium 1.6, \n\n02/04/92 Phosphorus 3.1, \n\n02/04/92 WBC 7.1, \n\n02/04/92 HCT 30.7 L, \n\n02/04/92 PLT 277, \n\n02/04/92 Superstat PT 13.0, \n\n02/04/92 Superstat APTT 29.1, \n\n02/04/92 NT-proBNP 1086 H\n\n\n\nCXR (AP): No radiographic evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary process.\n\n\n\nCT chest/abd/pelvis: 1. No evidence for pulmonary embolus to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries.  However, evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature is suboptimal due to respiratory motion. 2. No evidence for deep venous thrombosis. 3. Small right pleural effusion. 4. Intravenous contrast noted within the hepatic veins which could be secondary to CHF.\n\n\n\nEKG: NSR, LVH, 1st degree AVB, nonspecific ST, TW changes.\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 73 year old woman with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia who presents with exertional dyspnea. The patient's history, exam and CXR are not consistent with CHF. The CT scan r/o PE and may be consistent w/ failure, but not clear. More likely would be ischemia and is ruling out for an MI. Clearly needs cardiac reassessment with echo and ETT. Last ETT in 2085 but was normal at a very low level of exertion. Finally, could this be a primary pulmonary process? If her 02 sat of 78% in the ED is true, this should be pursued if cardiac evaluation is negative. Specifically could she have an interstitial pulmonary process corresponding to imaging and exam w/ fine crackles. Arguing against this is the acuteness of her symptoms. Continue current regimen w/ holding Avandia and metformin.\n\n\n\nPage #96082\n\n\n\nSigned electronically by Oconnell, Philip D on Feb 05, 2092     \n\n\n\n",

Her resting O2 sats are back to baseline and she does not appear to be in significant decompensated failure.  Unfortunately, we don't have much more to offer her in the way of cure (she has declined other interventions with pulmonlogist), as this is generally a terminal illness.\n\n\n\nPlan:\n\n\n\n--admit to medicine for further obs on tele.\n\n--complete cycling enzymes\n\n--continue outpatient lasix dose.\n\n--adjust n/c oxygen as needed\n\n--pulm/pt rehab consult -- pt has declined inpt rehab, but whatever might be offered as outpt would be helpful.\n\n--i will speak with her re: potential for hospice care since she has declined inpt rehab at last and with this admission.  This might help forgo further hosptilizations with similar treatment at home.\n\n--Continue DM treatment w/ glucophage/glyburide.\n\n--anticipate d/c in 1-2 days.\n\n-- pls offer pneumovax if she'll accept it.\n\n-- hold coumadin, recheck INR (pls have anticoag clinic leave note with dosing of coumadin)\n\n-- OOB to chair, ambulate with assistance.\n\n\n\nSigned electronically by Michael, Dana on Aug 2, 2092     \n\n\n\n",

She di dnot take tegretol, but rather increased her amytriptiline and added some darvocet acutely, now off these meds.  Her R eye \"tears a lot\", at no particular time (ie, not necessarily when she's masticating), and occasionally it burns....but she has not developed conjunctivitis or ocular redness or discharge.  She has difficulty chewing opn the R side of her mouth, and finds she\"pockets\" food in her R cheek; she manages by chewing on L, and swallowing frequently, especially taking extra liquids.\n\nThe pain has receded-  she now only gets \"a twinge\" now and then.\n\n\n\nHusband has noticed she's not hearing quite as well.\n\n\n\nHer current meds include amitryptiline 25 hs, mevacor 20, procardia 30 bid, furosemide 40x3, isosorbide 20 qd allopurinol 300 qd.  She's releived to learn the results of her recent blood work, including BUN 65 Creat 3.4, Hct 29.8\n\n\n\nOn exam, she has gained weight since I last saw her; she comes in ok0on wheelchair, but is able to take a few steps with her straight cane, and climb onto the examining tabloe with only contact guard. Dense catarcts; fundi not visualized; EOMS full without ptosis or nystagmus. Cornelas are brisk pilaterally, but she has decreased sensationon the R lower facial segments (V1, V2); excellent masseter and temporalis strength. R lower facial weakness, with less evident weakness of orbicularis oculi; he manages to close the eyelid almost completely; + Bell's phenomenon.  She hears finger rub at 90 cm on R, 70 cm on L; Weber lateralizes to the R, but Rinne' positive bilatyerally (ie, AC>BC AU). Tongue midline.  Modulates voice well.  TMs opaque, but EACs clear.\n\n\n\nShe has a marked polyneuropathy, with decreased vibration from knuckles to elbows bilaterally Hyporeflexia throughout, but symmetrical.  Strength remains well conserved.\n\n\n\nIMP: improving R Bell's. MRI showed much motion, but no gross abnormalities\n\n\n\nPlan- continue with current management. I'd welcome the oportunity of seeing her again in about 6 months.\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatfield, Orvin L., M.D.\n\n\n\n",

Since her last visit to the clinic, she was evaluated by Dr. Frederick Archer who admitted her for a diagnostic angiogram, which revealed that she had adequate perfusion to the ankle level \nto heal the ulceration.  \n \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, Mrs. Fallon has ruborous discoloration of the distal half of her bilateral lower extremity with scattered vesicles on the anterior surface of her left lower extremity.  The \nulceration is on the posterior aspect of the right ankle.  It measured 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm.  The tissue is moist yellow subcutaneous tissue, the margin is clear.  In the setting of ruborous discoloration, it appears that Mrs. Fallon may have an acute flare of her chronic lipodermatosclerosis.   \nPLAN:  Daily wound care per the following protocol; 1.  Normal saline irrigation 30 cc x 3.  A thin layer of 50% Diprolene ointment 0.05% with Bactroban cream to the wound bed and the wide periwound margin.  Primary dressing will be Telfa covered with rolled gauze.  Mrs. Fallon will return to clinic in 2 weeks unless the wound bed is closed and then she will follow up with Dr. Archer on Tuesday, November 26th.  \n \n______________________________ \nPatricia Drake, N.P., Ph.D.  \n \nDD:11/11/2074 \nDT:11/12/2074 \nDE:38535     :70 \n \n\n\n\n\n",

There is\n\ncalcification of the anterior and posterior mitral annulus.  There is no\n\nevidence of mitral valve prolapse.  The peak transmitral gradient is 10 mmHg.\n\nThe mean transmitral gradient is 5 mmHg.  There is mild to moderate mitral\n\nregurgitation by color and spectral Doppler.\n\nLEFT ATRIUM\n\nThe left atrium is dilated.\n\n\n\nAORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT\n\nMultiple aortic leaflets are thickened but there is no stenosis.  The aortic\n\nvalve is tricuspid.  There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or\n\nspectral Doppler.\n\n\n\nLEFT VENTRICLE\n\nThe left ventricular cavity size is normal.  The left ventricular systolic\n\nfunction approaches the lower limits of normal.  There is symmetric left\n\nventricular hypertrophy.  There is segmental apical left ventricular\n\ndysfunction (see wall motion plot).  There is no evidence of left ventricular\n\nthrombus.  The estimated ejection fraction is 51 %.\n\n\n\nTRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC\n\nThere is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency.\n\n\n\nRIGHT VENTRICLE\n\nThe right ventricle is not dilated.  The right ventricular systolic function\n\nis within normal limits.\n\n\n\nPERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES\n\nThere is no evidence of pericardial effusion.  There is a space between\n\nvisceral and parietal pericardium most c/w pericardial fat.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCompared to the study of 9/12/73, the EF has dropped by 10% and apical wall\n\nmotion abnormalities are now noted.\n\n\n\n\n\nCCU Course/Plan\t\n\n72 year old woman with ESRD, positive troponin in setting SOB and pulmonary oedema on CXR.

This lead to ESRD and hemodialysis starting 18 months ago, using a left forearm AV fistula that recently required catheter based intervention after clogging for a second time. Also related, at least in part, to her diabetic disease is coronary artery disease leading to a non-ST elevation MI in December 2074. Since then she has had bouts of what appears to be her anginal equivalent- left ear pain and a sense of fullness in her lower chest that occur at rest and are fleeting, going away before she has time to try a SLTNG. In addition, Ms. Fallon states that her blood pressures have run much lower, on occasion preventing the removal of fluid during dialysis, which leaves her edematous and more fatigued than normal. She is on a STTh HD schedule, but came to the EW four nights ago with hypotension in the setting of HD. She did not go to HD today, as her SBP was again too low.  Using a home machine, Ms. Fallon recorded SBPs in the 80's and complains of frequent periods of dizziness, especially when getting up from the seated position. She is unable to lie flat 2/2 to orthopnea. She denies recent fevers, chills, SOB or chest pain. Lower extremity swelling continues to be a problem and she is complaining of left heel pain.\n\n\n\nPMH: ESRD as a result of DM on HD, DM related retinopathy/neuropathy; h/o infected tunneled catheter; hyperparathyroidism; HTN in the past; CAD s/p NSTEMI 12/74, echo in Jan 2074 showed EF 52%; CHF;  PVD with RLE ulcer followed by Dr. Archer; h/o  GI bleed with negative upper endoscopy , pending colonoscopy, umbilical and hiatal hernia, cervical CA 6 years ago s/p hysterectomy; gout; benign breast tumor; h/o DVT s/p filter placement; h/ hypercalcemia, depression\n\n\n\nPSH: TAH 6 years ago; left arm AV fistula s/p thrombectomy x 2, most recently one week ago\n\n\n\nMedications: Allopurinol 200 po qd, Mevacor 20 po qd, Quinine 350 po BID, Concerta 3 tabs qd, Colace, Pericolace, Tylenol #3 prn, Nephrocaps 1 tab po qd, ASA 81 po qd, Lantus insulin 50 units qam, Tums 1 tab po tid with meals\n\nAlternative meds: None\n\nAllergies: MSO4 cause SOB; Novocaine causes seizure\n\n\n\nFamily history: Non-contributory\n\n\n\nSocial history: Lives at home with husband of 34 years, two children from previous marriage live in the area, has grandchildren. Used to work in construction.\n\n\n\nRisks: Never use tobacco, rarely used alcohol, no injection drug use\n\n\n\nReview of systems: (+) some vaginal blood spotting recently. No recent HA, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, cough, sputum production, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, abdominal pain.\n\n\n\nPE: Elderly, pale woman in NAD. T 97.7 degrees, BP 117/62, HR 84, RR 24, Sat 99% on RA. HEENT: NC,ST, PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, non-injected, arcus senilis no oto/rhinorrhea, oral mucosa moist, no cervical LAD or tenderness, no thyromegaly, neck supple, no supraclavicular LAD or bruits. HEART- RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no S3, S4 or murmur. PULM- CTA bilaterally with moderate to good BS bilaterally, no wheeze, rales or rhonchi. ABD- soft, NT, ND, BS+, reducible herniano HSM or masses, no aortic, hepatic or renal bruits. EXT- Bilateral brawny edema of LE. SKIN- changes if chronic venous statis of LE with tender shallow fissure of left heel. NEURO- A/O x 3, conversant, well-formed sentences, appropriate although somewhat flat, but laughed occasionally, CN 2-12 intact, visual fields intact bilaterally, DTRs 1+ and symmetric in triceps, biceps, quads and achilles, strength 4/5 bilateral U and LE\n\n\n\nData: Na 136, K 5.6, Cl 96, HCO3 29, BUN 69, Cr 10.2, Glu 96, Ca 9.3, PO4 6.9, Mg 2.0, Alb 2.9; WBC 12.2 no diff, HCT 32.7, PLT 247; PT 13.5, PTT 24\n\n\n\nECG: NSR with occasional ectopy, RBBB and 1st degree AV block, no e/o ischemia or infarction\n\n\n\nImaging:  CXR today shows pulmonary venous hypertension with interstitial edema and small pleural effusions bilaterally. Patchy opacity at the left lung base most likely represents alveolar edema or atelectasis.\n\n\n\nCODE status: Unknown\n\n\n\nFocused problem list:  Hypotension limiting hemodialysis s/p MI 3 months ago, DM, neuropathy, depression\n\n\n\nA/P: 73 year old woman with likely autonomic instability resulting from long-standing diabetes. In order to effectively counter the level of hypotension that she experiences after HD, she may benefit from interventions that will raise the systemic BP.\n\n\n\n1)\tBlood pressure\n\n-   Adenosine-stress MIBI today\n\n-\tIf the above is OK, plant to start midodrine 5 mg po tid\n\n\n\n2)\tRenal failure\n\n-   Check lytes in AM\n\n-\tTo HD in AM\n\n-\tAlready received kayexalate in EW tonight\n\n-\tIncrease Tums to 2 tabs po tid with meals for hyperphosphatemia\n\n\n\n3)\tVaginal spotting\n\n-   Pt has a gynecologist here at RH, will contact re: imaging vs other, esp in setting of h/o cervical CA\n\n-\tHCT stable\n\n\n\n______________________________                              \n\n\n\nKeith H.

She states she lost her footing \nwhile wearing some high heel shoes and fell in a twisting motion, \nsustaining an injury to her foot and ankle.  She was seen at \nOtis Hospital where an open tib-fib fracture was identified. \nShe denied any other injury.  She denied head injury, neck pain, \nback pain, or chest pain. \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for insulin requiring diabetes and \nhypertension, as well as renal insufficiency. \nMEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Cozaar, Lipitor, Lasix, and Procan. \nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. \nSOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  She does admit to drinking \ntonight and on a fairly regular basis. \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Alert and oriented.  She did have \nthe odor of alcohol on her breath.  HEAD:  Atraumatic.  NECK:  Full \nrange of motion, non-tender.  CHEST:  Clavicles and chest were \nnon-tender.  LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.  HEART:  Normal S1 and \nS2.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and non-tender.  PELVIS & EXTREMITIES: \nUnremarkable with the exception of the right ankle, which is in a \nplaster splint.  When removed laceration was seen just proximal to \nthe medial malleolus.  There was a normal pulse and capillary \nrefill in the extremity. \nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  X-rays revealed a fracture underlying the \nlaceration of the tibia.  There was also a distal fibular fracture \nas well.  The mortise appeared intact.  Chest x-ray was clear. \nElectrocardiogram is pending.  Laboratory studies showed a normal \nCBC, glucose of 291, and creatinine of 1.9 from the other facility. \nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient will be taken to the \noperating room for wash-out and open reduction and internal \nfixation procedure. \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Open tib-fib fracture. \nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is \npresently in stable condition. \n___________________________________                    SS758/93822 \nQUINTON COLON, M.D.   QC22                             D:02/05/81 \n                                                       T:02/05/81 \nDictated by:  QUINTON COLON, M.D.   QC22 \n\n\n\n\n",

She reports having\n\nhad a blood transfusion in 2059 and has had no history of other\n\npercutaneous exposure including intravenous drug use.  She has had\n\nnormal transaminases in the past but a positive hepatitis C\n\nantibody test.  She reports no abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting,\n\nanorexia or weight loss, no diarrhea, constipation, melena or\n\nbright red blood per rectum.  She has had no fevers, chills,\n\nsweats, arthralgias, myalgias or skin rash, epistaxis, easy\n\nbruising or bleeding gums and she has no insomnia or episodes of\n\nconfusion.  She reports a generally good energy level with some\n\nmild fatigue.  \n\n \n\nPast Medical History:\n\n     1.  Hypertension.\n\n     2.  Diabetes.\n\n     3.  Chronic renal insufficiency.\n\n     4.  Hyperlipidemia.\n\n \n\nCurrent Medications:  Humulin NPH 20 units qAM, 15 qPM, Humulin\n\nRegular insulin 3 units qAM, 5 qPM, Lipitor 40 mg po q.h.s.,\n\nProcrit 3,000 units sub q. bi week, Lasix 40 mg po q. day, Quinine\n\n260 mg po q.h.s. and Hyzaar 100/25 mg po q. day as well as Naftin\n\nprn.\n\n \n\nAllergies:  Lisinopril causes cough.\n\n \n\nFamily History:  No history of liver disease or GI malignancies.  \n\nSocial History:  She continues to smoke but has cut back recently\n\nand she drinks alcohol approximately once a week to once every two\n\nweeks.  \n\n \n\nReview of systems otherwise negative for HEENT, cardiovascular,\n\nrespiratory, GI, GU, musculoskeletal or neurological systems.\n\n \n\nOn exam, she is a well-appearing woman in no acute distress.  Pulse\n\n80 and regular, blood pressure 152/76, weight 151 pounds.  HEENT\n\nshe is anicteric with equal, round, reactive pupils and normal\n\nconjunctivae.  Oropharynx reveals no ulcers or icterus.  Neck\n\nreveals no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Chest is clear to\n\nauscultation and percussion.  Heart reveals a regular rate and\n\nrhythm, S1 and S2 are present without murmur, rub or gallop.  \n\nXanders, Ruth\n\nMR #564-19-92-7               -2-            December 16, 2081\n\n \n\nAbdomen is soft, nontender and non-distended with no\n\nhepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Extremities reveal no clubbing,\n\ncyanosis or edema.  \n\n \n\nMost recent labs from October 22, 2081 reveal an ALT of 13, AST 19,\n\nalkaline phosphatase 78, bilirubin 0.3, creatinine 3.1, albumin\n\n3.6.  \n\n \n\nImpression:  Ms. Xanders has a history of a positive hepatitis C\n\nantibody with normal LFT's.  Today, we will check a hepatitis C RNA\n\nlevel to see if she is in fact viremic or whether she is one of the\n\nlucky 15% of people who clear the virus but remain antibody\n\npositive.  If she does not have hepatitis C RNA in her blood, than\n\nshe requires no further workup.  However, if she is RNA positive\n\nthan I would suggest a liver biopsy to assess the degree of\n\ninflammation of fibrosis in her liver and make possible plans for\n\ntreatment with interferon/ribavirin.  She is amenable to this and\n\nwe will follow-up in two weeks by phone to discuss the results of\n\nher RNA test.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nQuanterius L.

Hypertension.\n2. Pedal edema.\n3. Diabetes.\n\nHPI: Ruth is a 42 year old woman who presents for follow\nup of medical issues as well as for new pedal edema over the\npast 2 weeks.  When I saw her a few weeks ago, she was very\ndehydrated and required a decrease in dose of her Lasix due\nto symptoms of dehydration as well as a rise in her\ncreatinine and BUN.  She responded well to this and then did\nwell for a week or so.  Then she saw Dr. Vuong who\nincreased her dose of Lasix back to 20 mg in the evening. \nSubsequently, she developed pedal edema which, at times, is\nup to her knees and has been very bothersome for her.  Of\nnote, she started Norvasc within the past few months and it\nwas gradually increased to 10 mg a day.  She reports her\nblood sugars have been under excellent control, ranging from\n90-120s-140s especially over the past couple of weeks.  She\nhas had a couple of lows in the 40s over the past couple of\nmonths.  She again has not yet followed up with Dr. Vicki\nKlein as I had recommended for help with her diabetes.  She\nreports her blood pressure in Dr. Vuong's office was\nnormal as well.  She denies any orthopnea, PND, increased\nshortness of breath or dyspnea on exertion.  No fever or\nchills.  Remainder review of systems negative.  She does\nreport sweating with meals that she is unsure how long she\nhas had but has noted it over the past few months. \n\nMEDICATIONS: As noted in the record and confirmed.\n\nALLERGIES: Lisinopril causes cough.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is a pleasant woman in no acute\ndistress.  Her skin is very tanned.  Blood pressure 148/62,\non repeat it is 160/70, pulse of 88, weight of 150, weight\nis up about 6 pounds for her.  HEENT within normal limits. \nNeck: no JVD.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no\ncrackles or rhonchi.  Cardiovascular exam: normal S1, S2,\nII/VI systolic murmur at right sternal border.  Abdomen is\nbenign.  Extremities: she has 1-2+ pitting pedal edema to\nmid shin.  \n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN: 42 year old woman with:\n1. New pedal edema.  Reviewing patient's recent lab results,\nshe does have proteinuria but it is actually improved since\nthe last time it was checked and also her creatinine has\nimproved.  I believe the pedal edema may be related to the\nNorvasc.  Therefore, I advised her to stop the Norvasc and\nshe will call me tomorrow to let me know how she is doing as\nit may take a few days to resolve.  Will consider increasing\nher Lasix based on how she responds to discontinuing the\nNorvasc and her labs.  Will check basic metabolic panel and\nurinalysis as well.\n2. Hypertension since discontinuing Norvasc.  Will start\natenolol in a low dose but advised her not to start this for\nthe next few days.  Will start at 12.5 mg a day and increase\nto 25 mg a day and she will follow up in the next few weeks\nfor a repeat blood pressure check.\n3. Diabetes.  The patient is strongly encouraged to make an\nappointment with Dr. Vicki Klein regarding the diabetes to\nsee if there is anything more we can do to change her\ninsulin regimen.  \n\nThe patient to follow up with me by phone tomorrow and\notherwise in the next 3 weeks for a blood pressure check and\nsooner if no resolution of her pedal edema.\n\n\n______________________________\nSusan A.

As you know, she is a lovely 47-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, cigarette smoking and end-stage renal disease for which she underwent transplantation in 2083. She is now under evaluation for pancreatic transplantation.  She has not had symptoms of angina or left ventricular dysfunction and LVEF has been normal.  An exercise test in July 2087 achieved 79% of the maximal predicted heart rate, no chest discomfort, but 1-mm of ST depression in the lateral leads.  Her other recent issues have included marked anemia, possibly related to her immunosuppressive drugs (negative upper and lower endoscopy) and transient hyperglycemia following a glucocorticoid bolus.\n\nAt the time of admission, the hematocrit remained in the low 20s and she was transfused in preparation for cardiac catheterization.  Appropriate bicarbonate and Mucomyst therapies were administered, and we also took advantage of the precatheterization time to reinforce the importance of smoking cessation.\n\nCoronary angiography on 08/11/2087 demonstrated a co-dominant system with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery with left to right collaterals perfusing that territory.  There was also a 95% stenosis of the proximal LAD.  After careful consideration of the options, Dr. Valdez placed a Cypher stent at that location successfully.  She tolerated the procedure well,  was ambulatory the following morning and the creatinine had actually improved to 2.0; the hematocrit remained \"stable\" in the mid 20s.  She will likely be discharged later today, following a discussion with the renal transplant service regarding augmenting her antihypertensive regime.\n\nShe understands the importance of uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy,  preferably for more than one year.\n\nIt was a pleasure to participate in Ms. Xanders's care.  A copy of the discharge abstract as list of discharge medications will be forwarded to you separately.\n\nWith best regards.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n______________________________\nStanley V Stanley, MD\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:3-2627386 KFFocus\n\n\n\nDD: 08/12/87\nDT: 08/12/87\nDV: 08/12/87\n\n\n\n",

As you know, he is a very pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who has a history of coronary disease, admitted to GMH in June 2077 after a non-ST-elevation MI, and had a bare-metal stent placed in his LAD.  He has done well since that procedure.  He denies any exertional chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, PND, orthopnea, pedal edema, lightheadedness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness.\n\nMedications:\nAspirin 325 mg daily.\nAtorvastatin 80 mg daily.\nMetoprolol 100 mg daily.\nLisinopril 2.5 mg daily.\nPlavix 75 mg daily.\nNexium 40 mg daily.\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n   Significant for,\nBenign prostatic hypertrophy.\nBasal cell carcinoma.\nGastroesophageal reflux.\nUmbilical hernia.\nHypertension.\nHyperlipidemia.\nCoronary artery disease.\n\n\n\tFamily history:\n   Significant for brother had an MI at age 68.  Father who had MIs in his 60s and a coronary artery bypass grafting.  Mother never had coronary disease.\n\n\n\tSocial history:\n   He is single.  Never married.  No children.  He never smoked.  He drinks one to two drinks a week.  He denies illicit drugs.  He also works as a Recruitment Officer.\n\nPhysical examination:\n\t\n-Pulse:   60 and regular\n-BP: 110/60  \n-resp. rate:   16 and unlabored\n-General:   He is a well-developed, well-nourished white male in no acute distress.  Alert and cooperative.  Oriented x 3\n-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Trachea is midline\n-Neck:   Thyroid is nonpalpable.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits.  JVP is less than 7 cm of water\n-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes\n-Cardiac:   Normal S1 and S2, a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border\n-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.  No organomegaly\n-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 1+ and symmetric.  He has no pedal edema.  He has no clubbing or cyanosis\n\nSelected recent labs:\n\n\t Last cholesterol was, 07/06/2077, showed total cholesterol 174, triglycerides 111, HDL 44, and LDL 108.\n\t\n\n\n\tOther Data:\n   The patient underwent exercise tolerance testing in August 2077 and was able to exercise for 6 minutes.  He had no chest pain.  Nuclear images showed no evidence of ischemia or previous infarct.  LV function was normal.\nEKG today shows normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, right bundle-branch block, and an old IMI.\n\n\n\tAssessment and plan:\n   In summary, this is a very pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who had an MI in June 2077, which was a non-ST-elevation MI.  He underwent stenting of his LAD.  Since that time, he has not had any exertional angina.  He has no evidence of fluid retention or decompensated congestive heart failure.  Blood pressure is fine today.  Cholesterol is not perfect, but acceptable.  He is on a high dose of atorvastatin.  He is on a good medical regimen and at this point, I would keep him on his current medicines and plan to see him back in another six months.  He would like to enter a Cardiac Rehab Program and I think that certainly is a reasonable thing to do.\n\nAs always, it is a pleasure to be able to participate in the care of this very pleasant gentleman.\n\nBest personal regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\nDominic Issa MD,PhD\n\n\t\nSigned electronically by  Dominic Issa, MD,PhD\nDocument Status: Final\n\n\n\n",

He has a history of chest pain and was evaluated at Klickitat Valley Hospital for the same by you and, I believe, Dr. Inglis. He reportedly had an echo and a treadmill test that were unconcerning. \n\nHis episodes of chest pain are interesting. He feels a sharp pain for maybe a second or two in his chest followed by rapid palpitations associated with some jaw aching. The palpitations are of sudden onset as well as sudden offset. They were occurring up to one time per day through his hospitalization at Klickitat Valley a couple of weeks ago and now have occurred on two occasions since discharge. He is otherwise in fairly good health.\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n   1) Nonalcoholic steatotic hepatosis \n2) Palpitations \n3) Rotator cuff surgery in 2071\n\n\t\n\n\tAllergies:\n\t\nNo known drug allergy\n\n\n\tMedications (Confirmed):\n\n\t\naspirin  81 mg po daily\npenicillin VK  500 mg po 4 x day\n\n\n\tFamily history:\n   Mother died at age 62 of a heart attack. He has four siblings, all in good health. \n\n\n\tSocial history:\n   He is married with two sons, age 21 and 18, both of whom are in good health. He works as an Revenue Officer for Springfield Armory Inc in Picture Rocks, Maine.\n\nHabits: He has never used street drugs. He does not smoke tobacco. He drinks 6 beers/alcohol per week and 2 cups of coffee per day.\n\n\n\tReview of systems:\n   Negative in detail as detailed on his questionnaire and confirmed during the office visit.\n\nPhysical examination:\n\t\n-BP: 110/70  \n-Pulse: 59  BPM regular\n-resp. rate: 16  unlabored\n-Skin:   without lesions or nodules.\n-HEENT:   EOMI.  PERRLA.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Conjunctivae noninjected.  Mucous membranes moist.  No oropharyngeal lesions.\n-Neck:   carotids 2+ without bruits; jugular venous pressure &lt;5 cm of water; thyroid without nodules; trachea midline.\n-Chest:   lungs clear to auscultation, resonant to percussion, and symmetric in expansion.\n-Cardiac:   regular with a normal S1/S2; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.\n-Abdomen:   soft, nontender, without organomegaly or other masses.\n-Extremities:   no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.\n-Neuro:   reflexes were 1+; cranial nerves 2-12 were intact; motor and sensory modalities were intact in all four extremities.\n\n\n\tEKG:\n   10/28/2078: Sinus bradycardia. Otherwise the tracing is within normal limits.\n\n\n\tAssessment and plan:\n   Mr. Martin has episodic palpitations associated with some chest discomfort. Sometimes it is difficult for patients to distinguish between palpitations and chest pain per se. It may also be that his palpitations raise his heart rate to the point where he becomes ischemic, notwithstanding the negative stress test that he had in the past. \n\nWe will request the records of the echo and the stress test so we can have them for our files here and I have asked him to complete a 30-day event recording and follow up with me after that has been completed. \n\nI will certainly keep you informed about how things progress. \n\nYours truly, \n\nNorman C. Ivers, M.D.\n\n\t\nNorman C. Ivers, MD\n\n\t\nTranscribed by: Nina Uresti\n\n\t\nSigned electronically by  Norman C. Ivers, MD\nDocument Status: Final\n\n\n\n",

He drinks 6 beers/alcohol per week and 2 cups of coffee per day.\n\n\n\tReview of systems:\n   Negative in detail as detailed on his questionnaire and confirmed during the office visit.\n\nPhysical examination:\n\t\n-BMI: 29.3  Overweight, moderate risk\n-Pulse: 64  BPM regular\n-resp. rate: 16  unlabored\n-height: 68  in.\n-weight: 192  lbs.\n-General:   Alert, pleasant and cooperative\n-Skin:   Warm, dry and intact\n-HEENT:   Normocephalic and atraumatic\n-Neck:   Trachea is midline, no thyromegaly, no lymphadenopathy, carotid pulses are 2+ equal bilaterally without bruits. \n-Chest:   Clear to auscultation anteriorly and posteriorly.  \n-Cardiac:   S1S2 without murmurs, rubs, gallops, thrills or heaves.

We have discussed the physiology of the electrical conduction system and the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation. We have discussed treatment options including rate control, rhythm control or pulmonary vein isolation. We have scheduled him for nuclear stress test to R/O ischemia given his symptoms of chest discomfort and new onset of atrial fibrillation and will send him for echocardiogram to R/O structural heart disease. \n\nWe have had a long discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and if his diagnostic testing is within normal limits he would like to possibly consider this as an option for treatment. We have started him on Toprol XL 50 mg daily. If his diagnostic testing is within normal limits we will proceed initially with starting Class IC antiarrhythmic for the treatment of his atrial fibrillation. We will continue a discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and continue medical management. He has a CHAD2 Score of 0. We will therefore recommend treating with Aspirin 325 mg daily for prophylactic embolic protection and would not recommend coumadin at this time. \n\nWe will complete diagnostic testing, follow up with the results and then proceed. We have encouraged him to call with any questions, concerns, or changes in health status. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions in regard to his care. \n\nVonda Tara Ulloa, NP \n\nThe patient was seen by Dr. Ivers who reviewed the history, physical examination and relevant diagnostic test reports and determined the assessment and plan. \n\nNorman C.

As you know, he is a 52-year-old male with recent history of palpitations discovered to be atrial fibrillation. Episodes have been associated with chest discomfort, jaw pain and chest thumping and we therefore had him complete nuclear stress test and echocardiogram to R/O structural heart disease. He is on Toprol XL 50 mg and aspirin. SESTA MIBI completed January 5, 2079 after 11 minutes, 13 METS and 90 MPHR was positive ischemia by ECG demonstrated by 2 mm ST depressions in leads II, AVF, and V6 and 2.5 mm ST depressions in leads III and V5. Myocardial scans showed mild anteroseptal and apical ischemia with EF 66%. He had no symptoms and there were occasional VPCs and PACs. Echocardiogram was normal with exception to mildly dilated LA 40 mm. \n\nSince his last visit he has had two additional of episodes of atrial fibrillation with complaint of rapid heart action, jaw pain and chest discomfort. The episodes lasted approximately 10 minutes and were relieved by rest. He denied lightheadedness, dizziness, pre syncope, syncope, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis. Of note they occurred this time with exercise as opposed to at rest and they seemed more severe in nature. \n\n\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n   1. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation \n2. Nonalcoholic steatotic hepatitis \n3. Palpitations \n4. Rotator cuff surgery in 2071\n\n\t\n\n\tChanges to Allergies\n\t\nNKA: No Known Allergies - reaction: [reviewed]\n\n\n\tMedications (Confirmed):\n\n\t\naspirin  81 mg po daily\n\n\n\tFamily history:\n   Mother died at age 62 of a heart attack. He has four siblings, all in good health. \n\n\n\tSocial history:\n   He is married with two sons, age 21 and 18, both of whom are in good health. He works as an Revenue Officer for Springfield Armory Inc in Picture Rocks, Maine. \n\nHabits: He has never used street drugs. He does not smoke tobacco. He drinks 6 beers/alcohol per week and 2 cups of coffee per day.\n\n\n\tReview of systems:\n   Negative in detail as detailed on his questionnaire and confirmed during the office visit.\n\nPhysical examination:\n\t\n-BMI: 28.8  Overweight, moderate risk\n-Pulse: 55  BPM regular\n-resp. rate: 16-18  unlabored\n-height: 68  in.\n-weight: 189  lbs.\n-General:   Alert, pleasant and cooperative\n-Skin:   Warm, dry and intact\n-HEENT:   Normocephalic and atraumatic\n-Neck:   Trachea is midline, no thyromegaly, no lymphadenopathy, carotid pulses are 2+ equal bilaterally without bruits. \n-Cardiac:   S1S2 without murmurs, rubs, gallops, thrills or heaves.

Aortic valve is tricuspid, no AI. LV cavity size and systolic function is within normal limits without evidence of segmental wall motion abnormalities and EF 76%. Right atrial dilatation. Normal RV. LA 40 mm, LVIDd 50 mm, LVIDs 29 mm, PWT 10 mm, IVS 10 mm and LVEF 76%. \n\n\n\tAssessment and plan:\n   Mr. Martin is a 52-year-old male with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and ischemia noted on recent SESTA MIBI. We have discussed the findings and have recommended proceeding with cardiac catheterization with potential coronary intervention. We have reviewed pre procedural expectations and procedural risk including femoral vascular complications, cardiac perforation, renal complications, stroke, heart attack, and death. He understands and has agreed to proceed. We have also discussed treatment options for atrial fibrillation. He continues to be interested in CRYO Ablation. We have had a long discussion in this regard. We will have to start medication therapy first and then proceed accordingly. His medication options are now limited due to ischemia.  Sotalol is the best option at this time. \n\nWe have spoken to Dr. Nagle who has agreed to complete his catheterization on January 24, 2079. If the dye load is minimal we may decide to complete in patient Sotalol load. We will assess after his angiogram. We have completed pre procedure blood work, CXR and urinalysis. \n\nWe have encouraged him to call with any questions, concerns or changes in health status. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions in regard to his care. \n\nVonda Tara Ulloa, NP \n\nThe patient was seen by Dr. Ivers who reviewed the history, physical examination and relevant diagnostic test reports and determined the assessment and plan. \n\nNorman C.

The \n\nhistory briefly is as follows.  This is a 51 year-old male who was \n\nrecently discharged from the hospital here after a successful \n\npercutaneous lithotripsy and nephrostomy placement.  He presented \n\nthis evening for a leakage from his nephrostomy tube which he \n\nbelieves may have become dislodged or had its cap removed when he \n\nwas sitting on the sofa and got up.  He has been leaking \n\nserosanguineous fluid since earlier today.  He has no fever, \n\nchills.  No other complaints.  \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes diabetes, hypertension, CAD, high \n\ncholesterol.  \n\nMEDICATIONS:  He takes hydrochlorothiazide, Zestril, Calan, Zocor \n\nand Levaquin.   \n\nALLERGIES:  He has no allergies to medications.  \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise negative.  \n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his family.  \n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  He has no significant family history.  \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His temperature is 99.2, heart rate 93, \n\nblood pressure 136/81.  He is an awake and alert male in no acute \n\ndistress.  HEENT - Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Oropharynx clear.  \n\nNeck is supple.  Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.  \n\nCardiovascular exam is regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub \n\nor gallop.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  Mildly obese.  Skin is \n\nwarm and dry.  Left flank is with some resolving ecchymosis.  No \n\nobvious subcutaneous fluid, and the area around the nephrostomy \n\ndrain is intact.  His gurney linens are soaked with serosanguineous \n\nfluid.  Extremities without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  \n\nNeurologically alert and oriented.  Cranial nerves II-XII are \n\nintact.  No motor or sensory deficits.   \n\nCONSULTATIONS:  He is seen in consultation by the Urology Service \n\nand his tubing was cut back and cap replaced.  It is unclear as \n\nthis was placed by Radiology exactly the exact \n\nconfiguration of the tubing.  However, it appears to have ceased \n\nleak at this time.  \n\nDISPOSITION:  He is discharged in satisfactory condition with \n\ninstructions to return for return of symptoms or for any other \n\nconcerns, and to call to have follow up arranged for early next \n\nweek. \n\n___________________________________                    VJ645/69473 \n\nULICES ELLIOT, M.D.  UE57                            D:07/19/25 \n\n                                                       T:07/19/25 \n\nDictated by:  ULICES ELLIOT, M.D.  UE57 \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He did have chest pressure at rest yesterday, which\n\ndid radiate to his left shoulder.  This seemed to resolve\n\nspontaneously and then he noted shortness of breath with any kind\n\nof exertion at all.  The shortness of breath was exclusively\n\nexertional.  He has not noticed nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis,\n\npresyncopal symptoms or diarrhea.  No fevers.  He does have a\n\nslight cough that is nonproductive.  He was seen at a local\n\nEmergency Department today where he had laboratory studies as\n\nwell as was given Lasix, albuterol, and nitroglycerin and states\n\nhe has some relief of his symptoms associated with this.  He was\n\ncardioverted 2 days ago for atrial fibrillation by his\n\ncardiologist at SAH.  Additionally, at the outside Emergency\n\nDepartment, his INR was therapeutic at 2 as he is on Coumadin,\n\nbut his troponin was elevated at 0.16.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, orally\n\ncontrolled diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and atrial flutter. \n\nHe has had a cardiac catheterization last in 2127.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a past smoker with 10 pack years of\n\nsmoking.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the written chart and HPI,\n\notherwise negative.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Coumadin, citalopram, metoprolol, lisinopril,\n\nglipizide, Cipro, and simvastatin.\n\nALLERGIES:  He is allergic to penicillin.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99, pulse 63, respiratory rate\n\n20, blood pressure 140/86, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air.\n\n HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pleasant, calm.  Neck is\n\nsupple.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation, except for\n\nscattered rales in the left lower lung field.  Cardiovascular: \n\nRegular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Abdomen is soft and\n\nnontender.  Skin is intact, warm, and dry.  Extremities:  He has\n\ngot 1+ edema of the bilateral lower extremities that is\n\nsymmetric.  Neuropsych:  He is oriented x3, moves all extremities\n\nequally.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  ECG shows a sinus rhythm at 65 with poor R-wave\n\nprogression, but no acute ST segment abnormalities.  Chest x-ray\n\nshows interstitial increased markings with a small left pleural\n\neffusion and prominence of the ventricle consistent with mild\n\npulmonary edema.  Cardiac biomarkers show troponin of 0.16 with\n\ncreatinine of 1.43, CK-MB of 3.2 with normal index, and CK of 87.\n\n BNP is still pending.  INR is 2.5, which is therapeutic on\n\nCoumadin.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  At the outside Emergency\n\nDepartment, he did receive Lasix and he put off approximately 2\n\nliters of urine since then with significant symptomatic\n\nimprovement in his dyspnea.  He has no further episodes of chest\n\npain or pressure.  I did discuss the case with Dr. Davison,\n\nthe SAH cardiologist on-call.  I believe this patient has CHF\n\nexacerbation.  He also was recently cardioverted, which ____\n\nexplain his troponin elevation.  Additionally, his CHF\n\nexacerbation alone could explain his troponin elevation, and I\n\ndoubt the patient has an acute coronary syndrome.  At this point,\n\nthe patient is already anticoagulated by virtue of being on\n\nCoumadin.  We will hold any further heparinization or Lovenox at\n\nthis time.  However, he will have serial cardiac biomarkers, will\n\nbe admitted to the Cardiology Service for evaluation and for\n\nfurther evaluation and optimization of his congestive heart\n\nfailure and for monitoring of his troponin levels.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure exacerbation, troponin\n\nelevation, and diabetes.\n\nDISPOSITION:  Admission in stable condition.\n\n______________________________\n\nCOOKE, FREDI M.D.\n\nD: 05/30/31\n\nT: 05/31/31\n\nDictated By: COOKE, FREDI\n\neScription document:0-8412167 BFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She says there was initially some redness, no warmth in these joints. She could not open or close her hands. She says the pain migrated to involve all of the joints in her hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders and knees. She noticed swelling in her R knee, no swelling or redness in other joints. Her muscles are diffusely tender. She recalls similar muscle discomfort in prior episodes attributed to fibromyalgia, although not as severe. She also remembers shoulder and elbow pain of similar but less intense character in 2128 while taking rifampin/cipro/azithro for MAC. These symptoms resolved when drugs were stopped. She denies recent fevers or chills. She completed an 8 day course of augmentin for MSSA PNA two days ago. Symptomatically she feels her PNA has resolved and she is at her baseline from a respiratory standpoint w/stable cough and SOB. She does report some mild L-sided pleuritic CP since yesterday. She denies weight loss, skin changes, rash, change in BMs, N/V, dry mouth, change in vision, weakness, paresthesias. ROS + for brittle nails, eye dryness not bothersome. FH notable for mother w/scleroderma.\n\n\n\nHer symptoms did not respond to Excedrin and she presented to the ER 11/12. Exam notable for BP 212/93, HR 125, T 98, SO2 98%,    tenderness w/movement in UE's, R knee   . WBC 11.7, HCT 39.8, PLT 421, chem. 10 wnl, CXR w/stable bibasilar lung nodularity. She was admitted to Internal Medicine for further evaluation. She reports decreased pain with Demerol, interval improvement in hand joint swelling/erythema/stiffness.\n\n\n\nPMH:\n\nBronchiectasis: Recurrent PNA since 3yo, s/p RML lobectomy 2128\n\nMAC: Treatment interrupted 2/2 liver failure 2128\n\nDiverticulitis c/b perforation and sigmoid resection 2129\n\nRaynaud's\n\nFibromyalgia: Dx 2122 when she p/w neck, shoulder, hip, chest wall, knee and jaw pain; followed by Dr. Christopher Sharp at DCHC\n\nMigraine headaches\n\nHTN\n\nGERD\n\nHiatal and ventral hernias\n\nS/p appy\n\nOsteopenia\n\n\n\nHome Meds:  \n\nMedroxyprogesterone 5mg qd\n\nEstradiol 2mg qd\n\nPrilosec 20mg qd\n\nInderal 120mg qd\n\nNortriptyline 75mg qd\n\nColace 100 bid\n\nVitamin C + E\n\nPrn fioricet, Excedrin, imitrex\n\n\n\nCurrent Meds:\n\nNortriptyline 75 mg qhs\n\nInderal 240mg qd\n\nNexium 20mg qd\n\nPrn Demerol\n\n\n\nAll:\n\nPercocet/Darvon/Codeine-GI upset\n\nSulfa-   kidney problem   \n\nFlagyl-   throat closed   \n\nLevaquin, azithromycin-rash\n\n  \t\n\nSH:  \tRetired Firefighter, no ETOH, tobacco or drugs \n\n\n\nFH:\tMother w/systemic scleroderma (joint pain and swelling, skin changes, Raynaud's), CAD, DM died at 68 yo\n\n\n\nExam:  \t\n\n\tVS:  \tAfebrile Tc 97.5; BP 164/80; HR 84; RR 20\n\n\tHEENT: Anicteric, OP clear no lesions\n\n\tLungs:  Decreased BS at bases\n\n\tCor:  \tRRR no M/R/G, JVP 8\n\n\tAbd:  \tSoft, NT, ND, reducible hernia R of midline\n\n\tMSK: Marked muscle tenderness to palpation, particularly involving chest, arms, legs; mild boney tenderness along entire spine; decreased lateral, forward flexion and extension of neck which she reports is baseline; shoulders, elbows and wrists with full ROM, NT; slight tissue swelling/?synovitis involving MCP joints bilaterally, particularly L first MCP, no warmth or erythema; no PIP or DIP finger joint abnormalities; hips somewhat stiff but w/full ROM; R>L knee crepitus, full ROM; ankles w/full ROM; strength intact\n\n\tSkin/nails: No rashes, petechiae, or nail changes  \n\n\t\n\nLabs:\n\nPCH  BLOOD          13-Nov-2133 09:58  Accession# 8326S84259\n\n\n\nWBC                              9.9                       (4.5-11.0)       th/cmm\n\nHCT                              36.0                      (36.0-46.0)      %\n\nHGB                              12.7                      (12.0-16.0)      gm/dl\n\nRBC                              4.06                      (4.00-5.20)      mil/cmm\n\nPLT                              437              H        (150-350)        th/cumm\n\nMCV                              89                        (80-100)         fl\n\nMCH                              31.4                      (26.0-34.0)      pg/rbc\n\nMCHC                             35.4                      (31.0-37.0)      g/dl\n\nRDW                              13.3                      (11.5-14.5)      %\n\nESR                              79               H        (1-25)           mm/hr\n\n\n\nPlasma Sodium                    134              L        (135-145)        mmol/L\n\nPlasma Potassium                 3.6                       (3.4-4.8)        mmol/L\n\nPlasma Chloride                  99               L        (100-108)        mmol/L\n\nPlasma Carbon Dioxide            25.0                      (23.0-31.9)      mmol/L\n\nCalcium                          9.1                       (8.5-10.5)       mg/dl\n\nPhosphorus                       2.7                       (2.6-4.5)        mg/dl\n\nMagnesium                        1.5                       (1.4-2.0)        meq/L\n\nPlasma Urea Nitrogen             10                        (8-25)           mg/dl\n\nPlasma Creatinine                0.8                       (0.6-1.5)        mg/dl\n\nThyroid Stimulating Hormone      0.96                      (0.40-5.00)      uU/ml\n\n\n\nBlood Culture - Pending\n\n\n\nPCH  PA & Lat.

The constellation of myalgias, arthralgias/synovitis, ?pleurisy, Raynaud's, GERD, HTN and +FH invoke the possibility of scleroderma. Rarely, a variant of this disease can present without skin manifestations (systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma). The transient nature of her joint symptomatology is c/w possible crystal disease. The bilateral hand distribution is typical, but progression to involve other joints such as the knee is not. Postviral arthralgias/myalgias is another consideration given the quick resolution of the process. Her myalgias may well represent underlying fibromyalgia. We recommend\n\n  \tIf available, past ANA, RF, ESR\n\n  \tPlease check ANA, RF, parvovirus IgM and IgG, uric acid level, U/A\n\n  \tPlain films of bilateral hands, R knee\n\nThank you for this interesting consult.

Her most recent episode peaked 3 weeks ago with a violent cough, sore throat, and ear pain. She was sputum culture positive for moraxella and started on a 19 day course of Ketek (Telithromycin) with some resolution of symptoms over the first 8 days. She reports worsening of symptoms over the last 4 days PTA to include increasing SOB, malaise, intermittent muscular back pain and worsening cough. She denies hemoptysis. She denies fever, nausea or vomiting. She does report 3 days of diarrhea which has subsided on the day of admission. She denies PND, or increased LE edema.

She has failed a recent course of Telithromycin in the setting of moraxella culture positive sputum. We will repeat sputum cultures and start vancomycin and ceftriaxone IV here. We will get Chest Films and supplement her home pulmonary regimen with Nebulized albuterol q 4 hrs.  I have encouraged frequent ambulation. She will continue to use her home flutter valve. Her husband provides Chest PT at home and we may order this if appropriate in house.\n\n\n\nWe will continue her home Inderal at 240 mg qd. This will be supplemented with an ACE I and hydralazine as necessary. The use of an ACE I will be discussed with her PCP as this may have been avoided second to chronic cough. She is not a candidate for Lasix or HCTZ due to her sulfa allergy. Her admission BP of 187/97 was in the setting of a delay in today's dose of inderal. She was asymptomatic with this high pressure. \n\n\n\nWe will continue her hormone replacement, GERD prophylaxis with nexium and nightly nortryptiline.  She will be ambulatory and not require DVT prophylaxis. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nName: William Uecker                               \n\nPager #: 95321\n\nPGY-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Pt awoke this morning in her USOH but quickly had sudden onset of 10/10 sharp SSCP radiating to her right arm associated w/ right arm numbness.  Pain is slightly better w/ sitting up though pt denies pleuritic quality.  She then had a vasovagal attack, which she has had before in the setting of pain, and she started to feel lightheaded, nauseated, and diaphoretic.  She laid down on the floor and elevated her legs above her head which helped a little.  Her husband gave her Excedrin w/o improvement and called 911.  EMS gave her 3 puffs of NTG and 4 baby ASA w/o effect.  The ambulance brought her to the closest hospital, Colorow.  In the ED, she was found to be hypertensive w/ SBP 180s, for which she was started on TNG gtt.  She also underwent PE CT which per report was neg for PE but showed bilat DVTs, and she was started on heparin.  She was given fioricet, zofran, and fentanyl for her CP w/ relief.  She was then given a dose of IV lopressor and also had one episode of N/V.  Her labs were significant for + cardiac markers: 1st set w/ CK/MB/index 39/0.9/2.3, trop I 0.03, 2nd 443/57.3/12.9, trop 2.22, 3rd set 686/87.3/12.7, trop 4.18.  EKGs showed right-bundle morphology (though QRS not wide) w/ initial TWI V1-V3 which progressed to deepening TWI V1-V4 and some downsloping STD V3-V4.  Pt is currently chest pain free, no SOB, no palpitations.  She denies any preceding viral illness or any surprises or acute stressors in her life, though she has many chronic medical problems.\n\n\n\nROS:    as per HPI\n\n\n\nPMH:\n\n     1.

pain free.  Possible etiologies for her chest pain w/ + cardiac markers include ACS, PE, myopericarditis, spasm, or apical ballooning syndrome.  Dissection less likely w/ equal pulses and not seen on PE CT.  Her EKG changes suggest an element of RV strain, though this is not borne out on TTE, and review of her OSH CT w/ radiology here did not reveal PEs (at least to the level of subsegmental arteries).  Her TTE did not show WMA, and her story could be c/w ACS or c/w myopericarditis or apical ballooning syndrome (esp w/ hx of fibromyalgia, raynaud   s, migraines, etc), though w/ + cardiac enzymes and dynamic EKG changes, need to have low threshold to cath if develops pain.\n\n\n\nPlan: \n\n\n\n1.\tischemia\n\nbblocker, ASA\n\ncheck fasting lipids, start statin\n\ncont heparin, restart TNG gtt if pain recurs\n\nstart IIbIIIa if persistent pain\n\n\n\n2.\trhythm\n\nNSR\n\nOn bblocker\n\n\n\n3.\t?

She still has pain in\nthe right hip and the left hip, which is likely due to\nosteoarthritis.  She has been taking Percocet for pain\ncontrol.  Fortunately, she is not having problems with\nconstipation, as she is taking a stool softener.  She is\ntaking calcitonin and Evista for her osteoporosis.  In\naddition, she has had a history of right tibial\nosteomyelitis and is taking prophylactic Levaquin, without\nevidence of GI upset or antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  She\nis taking Cozaar for her blood pressure control, and is also\ntaking Neurontin for pain control.  At home, she is wearing\na firm brace that Dr. Younce has prescribed.  In addition,\nshe is using a walker for ambulation when outside the house\nand a cane when inside the house.  She comes today for her\nappointment with her son.  She arrived in a wheelchair.\n\nOn examination, her blood pressure today is 138/80 with a\npulse of 80 and a respiratory rate of 16.  She is afebrile.\nCardiac exam is a regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, without\nmurmurs.  Her neck is supple, although she does have\nparacervical pain to palpation.  Her lungs are clear to\nauscultation.  She has pain throughout the paraspinal\nmuscles in the thoracic and lumbosacral area.  She has some\npain with flexion at the hip, with limited motion at both\nhips.  She has no evidence of lower extremity erythema or\nedema.  Her peripheral pulses are intact.  Her patellar\nreflexes are absent.  She has good pedal pulses.  She denies\ndepression and overall is encouraged.  She plans a trip to\nPeru soon.\n\nMedications are updated in LMR.\n\nDISPOSITION: She will follow up with me for a complete\nphysical examination in November of this year, and she will\nbe fasting at that time.\n\n\n\nYonathan Turk, M.D.\nFort Washington Hospital\n\nKV:MD:9637  /  DD:6-17-89  /  DT:6-23-89\n\n\n\n",

She had her drain in the LLQ changed 7 days ago and devoloped some leaking from the drain in the past couple of days.\nShe was scheduled to come in to the Radiology department to change the drain.  She developed chest pain in the IR suite associated with increased BP and HR to 130 with deep ST changes in the anterolateral and inferior changes\nand new RBBB .  The chest pain was relieved with SL NTG and was taken\nto ER for eval. Since being in the ER, her symptoms have abated and EKG changes have improved to baseline.  Troponin/CPK are negative at baseline.\n\nPMHx: see below\n\nFamily Hx non contributory\n\nMeds : see med sheets.\n\nROS: no fever or chills, SOB +chronic LLQ pain o/w neg x 13\n\nExam: 72 16 134/76 afebrile.\nkyphotic elderly chronically ill appearing woman \nShe is alert and conversant in Spanish\nanicteric eomi\ncarotids w/o bruits\nno LAD\nno thyromegaly\ncta\nrrr s1s2 no s3\n+bs nd w/ drain in LLQ w/ foul smell\nno edema\n\nData: EKG w/ rate 130 w/ RBBB and deep ST ST changes in inferior and ant/lat leads.\n\na/p  She had chest pain and EKG changes with increased rate.\nIt is not clear if she received her medications from MC nursing home this AM\nIt is likely that she has demand ischemia.\nWould plan to cycle trop/cpk and resume medical managment.\nchange percutaneous tube w/ IR this w/e or Tuesday.\n\nDr. Reyes covering this weekend. 567 876 2685\n\n\n\nADMISSION DATE: 07/01/2095               DISCHARGE DATE: 07/08/2095\n     \n     \n     \n     PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Chest wall pain.\n     \n     ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: History of diverticulitis abscess, status post\n     percutaneous drainage on 01/18/2095 with a colocutaneous fistula;\n     hypertension; fibromyalgia; gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophageal\n     motility disorder; history of right tibial osteomyelitis in 2086; history\n     of osteoarthritis, status post right and left total hip arthroplasty in\n     2088 and 2089; varicose veins with a history of chronic venous\n     insufficiency ulcers in the past; status post esophageal dilatation,\n     12/2093; atypical chest pain.\n     \n     PROCEDURES: Surgical consultation with Dr. Yonathan Orth; interventional\n     radiation radiology consultation; adenosine sestamibi stress test;\n     pulmonary embolus CT of the chest; abdominal CT scan.\n     \n     HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old woman who is a\n     Broadcasting and Performing Arts Manager who had been in the McDonough County Nursing Home until the day\n     of admission when she woke up with right-sided and epigastric chest\n     discomfort associated with shortness of breath that was associated with a\n     feeling of warmth rising from her upper abdomen up to her face.  She\n     described no radiation discomfort to her left arm, no diaphoresis.  She has\n     had these episodes in the past.  She was noted to be hypertensive at the\n     McDonough County Nursing Home, up to 200/130, and was given metoprolol 50 mg and\n     multiple sublingual nitroglycerins.  She was sent to Pan American Hospital\n     for further evaluation. In the emergency room, she received 3\n     nitroglycerins, Tylenol and morphine which helped relieved her pain.\n     \n     PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for the above, plus ischemic colitis. In\n     addition, she is debilitated and has lost a significant amount of weight,\n     approximately 40 to 50 pounds since January.  She also has asymptomatic\n     gallstones.\n     \n     MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg daily, Epogen 400 units subcu 3\n     times a week, mirtazapine 15 mg at bedtime, megestrol acetate 200 mg daily\n     until 07/15/2095, Colace 100 mg b.i.d. p.r.n. constipation, zinc 1 p.o.\n     daily, multivitamins 1 p.o. daily, Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily, metoprolol 50\n     mg b.i.d., methadone 5 mg b.i.d., isosorbide 20 mg t.i.d., ferrous sulfate\n     325 mg p.o., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily, lactulose p.r.n. constipation,\n     Dulcolax p.r.n. constipation, oxycodone 5 mg q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain.\n     \n     ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.\n     \n     PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She weighed 88.7 pounds, pulse 68 and regular,\n     respiratory rate 20 and unlabored, room-air oxygen saturation was 97%,\n     blood pressure was 160/90.  General appearance: Cachectic, elderly woman\n     who was in no acute distress.  HEENT: Mucous membranes were dry, pinpoint\n     pupils that were minimally reactive, extraocular motions were intact,\n     oropharynx without erythema.  JVP 4 cm supine.  There was no\n     lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.  Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, S1-S2.\n     There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.  Chest:\n     Clear to auscultation.  Abdomen: There was an IR drain in place in the left\n     lower quadrant without external drainage.  The abdomen was soft with mild\n     tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant without rebound or\n     guarding; bowel sounds are present throughout.  Extremities reveal no\n     edema.  There were chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally and ecchymosis\n     on the left side of her foot.  Pulses were 2+ and symmetric.\n     \n     Neurological exam: The patient has significant weakness of the bilateral\n     lower and upper extremities with -4/5 strength of the hands and 2+ strength\n     in the hip flexors, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, calf, and anterior\n     tibialis.\n     \n     LABORATORY DATA: On admission, white count 7700, hematocrit 30.3, platelets\n     443,000.  INR 1.4, potassium 4.0, creatinine 0.8, CPK and troponin were\n     negative x3.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without changes of ischemia.\n     Chest x-ray revealed no congestive heart failure or pneumonia.  Her\n     adenosine sestamibi stress test revealed no evidence of EKG or reversible\n     perfusion defects.  She did have evidence of a fixed defect in the inferior\n     heart with hypokinesis, with an LVEF of 75%.  CT of chest with a PE\n     protocol did not reveal any thrombus.\n     \n     HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Yonathan Orth\n     of general surgery.  The patient had expressed an interest in considering\n     colectomy after initially refusing colectomy since January 2095.\n     Initially, this was due to concerns about possible transfusion needs during\n     surgery.  After extensive\n     conversations with Dr. Orth and with her family, and with the patient,\n     I believe that the comorbidities associated with the surgery and\n     perioperative healing, far outweigh any potential benefits that she may\n     have from this potential surgery and therefore we collectively decided not\n     to pursue this.\n     \n     Chest pain: The patient had no evidence of ischemia by cardiac biomarkers.\n     Adenosine sestamibi did not reveal any reversible defects.  She will\n     continue to be treated with antihypertensives.  Her chest wall pain is\n     likely due to esophageal spasm.\n     \n     Gastrointestinal: Her esophageal spasms and GERD will be treated with PPI.\n     \n     Chronic pain syndrome: She has chronic pain from osteoarthritis and\n     fibromyalgia.  This has led to debilitating weakness in upper or lower\n     extremities and reliance upon chronic pain medications. At the time, we\n     will continue pain medications for her comfort.  Continue aggressive bowel\n     regimen.\n     \n     Feeding: The patient needs a soft mechanical diet in order to allow her to\n     eat and masticate as she has no dentures at present.  The family currently\n     working to try to obtain dentures for her.\n     \n     Resuscitation status: Per the patient's wishes, after extensive\n     conversation with family and patient, she does not desire heroic\n     intervention and is DO NOT RESUSCITATE AND DO NOT INTUBATE.\n     \n     DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily, Tylenol 650 mg p.o.\n     p.r.n., vitamin C 500 mg p.o. daily, aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, Colace 100\n     mg b.i.d., Epogen 4000 units 3 times a week, ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o.\n     daily, isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg p.o. t.i.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily,\n     milk of magnesia daily p.r.n. constipation, megestrol acetate suspension\n     200 mg p.o. daily to terminate on 07/15/2095, metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.,\n     mirtazapine 15 mg p.o. at bedtime, multivitamins 1 p.o. daily, oxycodone\n     p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain, Zocor 20 mg p.o. daily, zinc sulfate 220 mg p.o.\n     daily, methadone 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n     \n     DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred back to the McDonough County Rehabilitation Center.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     YONATHAN OLIVER TURK, M.D.\n     DICTATING FOR:\n     \n     Electronically Signed\n     YONATHAN OLIVER TURK, M.D. 08/14/2095 10:33\n\n\n\n\n",

They both attribute it to the Prilosec.\n\n\n\nHe now sleeps well and does not use his wedge.  He has no snoring, daytime hypersomnolence, or morning headaches - no longer falls asleep at work.\n\n\n\nAllergies and nasal congestion are not evident.\n\n\n\nNo lower extremity edema, swollen glands, or fevers.\n\n\n\nMildly less prominent exertional breathlessness - He now occasionally has to go up one flight of stairs without stopping.\n\n\n\nOn examination, he is well appearing.  Respiratory rate 22 and unlabored. Blood pressure 90/50 with a small cuff. Conjunctivae are clear.  Oropharynx is clear. Trachea is midline, no goiter or adenopathy. Back:  Normal configuration.  Chest:  Normal percussion note, good air movement bilaterally; fine expiratory crackles at the lateral bases.  Cardiac:  Faint left parasternal impulse, mildly prominent P2, normal S1, S2, without murmur, rub, or gallop.  JVP is 7 cm with borderline HJR.  Abdomen: Soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass. Extremities:  No cyanosis or edema, borderline clubbing.\n\n\n\nPulmonary function tests today show very stable values per spirometry, a slight down-   ..  in total lung capacity, but still approximately 70% predicted, and DLCO stable in the 60% predicted range.\n\n\n\nMy review of CT scan of the chest shows faint peripheral subpleural reticular pattern with cyst formation and no significant nodules.  \n\n\n\nImpression:\n\n\n\n1.\tInterstitial lung disease - Mild objective impairment by functional status.  Pulmonary function tests - Overall, these were stable, and the CT scan is quite suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis.  However, as I reviewed with the patient and his wife, it is well established that 10% of the time, another disorder, such as occult hypersensitivity pneumonitis or nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis can be found on lung biopsy.  There is no evidence of a rheumatologic disorder nor any evidence of chronic aspiration, other than that associated with GE reflux, to explain his lung disease.  He would be a very reasonable candidate for gamma interferon, although this likely would necessitate low-dose steroids - the latter treatment would certainly have an impact on his diabetes.\n\n\n\n2.\tGE reflux - This is the main source of his cough and is well established to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis.  If he is able to lose weight and change his lifestyle, he can have very good control of this.\n\n\n\n3.\tPossible mild pulmonary hypertension related to the pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n\n\n4.\tPossible sleep disorder - Currently is entirely without symptoms, now that his reflux is well controlled.\n\n\n\n5.\tChronic cough.\n\n\n\n6.\tDiabetes - Better controlled.\n\n\n\n7.\tObesity - He continues to need aggressive weight loss program.  As I mentioned to him, he would not be a candidate for lung transplantation evaluation while he is at such as weight, but he is starting to make some progress.\n\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\n\n\n1.\tContinue proton pump inhibitor at b.i.d. dosing, as well as lifestyle modifications, including marked decrease in caffeine intake.\n\n\n\n2.\tReferral to Dr. Harry Yerger for VATS lung biopsy.\n\n\n\n3.\tCardiovascular evaluation by you, prior to his surgery, would be appreciated.\n\n\n\nIt has been a pleasure to participate in his care.  Please feel free to call with any questions or comments.\n\n\n\nSincerely, \n\n\n\n\n\nPaul N. Tam, M.D.\n\n\n\nPNT/ivester/yanez\n\n      \n\n\n\n",

For example, he notes that going up the four stairs to the house with bundles he is mildly short of breath and has to rest.\n\n\n\nThe cough is slightly increased to 3/10, but is markedly better than on presentation.\n\n\n\nHe has no leg edema, chest pain, skin rash, joint problems, or fevers.\n\n\n\nHe has managed to lose 6 lbs. by giving up sweets, and his sugars are slightly better.  \n\n\n\nGE reflux is very well controlled.\n\n\n\nMedications:  Prilosec 20 mg b.i.d., aspirin, Glyset, Actose, metformin, metoprolol, Lipitor, and Hyzaar.\n\n\n\nOn Examination:  He is well appearing. Blood pressure 110/60, respiratory rate 20 and unlabored.  Oropharynx is clear.  Conjunctivae are clear. Trachea is midline, no goiter.  Chest:  Normal percussion note, well-healed VATS scar; fine inspiratory crackles 1/3 of the way up bilaterally with coarser crackles over the axilla.  Cardiac:  Normal apex beat, normal P2, no murmur, JVP less than 8 cm with equivocal HJR.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.  Extremities:  No edema, borderline clubbing, no cyanosis. \n\n\n\nExercise oximetry:  Saturation at rest 96% and after treadmill ergometry 94%.\n\n\n\nPulmonary function tests today by my review show an FEV1 and FVC that are decreased by approximately 10%, total lung capacity decreased by 1 liter, and DLCO down from 20 to 14.\n\n\n\nWeight is 238 lbs. (BMI 38).\n\n\n\nImpression:\n\n\n\n1.\tBiopsy-proven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - The biopsy reading is somewhat unusual, and I will review this at our Pulmonary group weekly meeting, particularly with an eye to agents that might possibly target to exclude muscle metaplasia.  I continue to think him a relatively high risk candidate for the low-benefit regiment of prednisone, with an immunosuppressant agent.  I think he may be a very good candidate for gamma-interferon, but unfortunately not every one benefits from this.  \n\n\n\nI emphasized strongly to he and his wife that his disease may have progressed, or could be made worse by the recent chest surgery and worsened gastroesophageal reflux.  If the disease was, indeed, progressing, we would need to proceed with lung transplantation workup.  The most significant contraindication currently to transplantation is his substantial obesity.  I calculated with him that he needed to have his weight down to 190 lbs. to get to a BMI of 30, and that by the time of listing he needed to have a BMI of approximately 32.  Hence, he has his work cut out for him.\n\n\n\n2.\tObesity - As above.\n\n\n\n3.\tDiabetes.\n\n\n\n4.\tPossible coronary artery disease - He apparently did fine on his preoperative cardiac workup.\n\n\n\n5.\tGE reflux - As mentioned.\n\n\n\n6.\tCough - Mainly due to GE reflux, and less prominent contribution from the pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\n\n\n1.\tAdd Reglan 10 mg b.i.d.\n\n\n\n2.\tContinue Prilosec 40 mg b.i.d. - as 20 mg b.i.d. did not give full control with the generic pills.\n\n\n\n3.\tWe will review pathology.\n\n\n\n4.\tFollow-up visit with full pulmonary function tests in one month.\n\n\n\n5.\tI strongly urged him to continue a steady, but progressive weight loss program - I expect that his life will depend upon it.  \n\n\n\nIt has been a pleasure to participate in his care.  Please feel free to call with any comments or questions.  \n\n\n\nSincerely, \n\n\n\n\n\nPaul N. Tam, M.D. \n\n\n\nPNT/ivester/yanez\n\n      \n\n\n\n",

He as treated with high dose Solumedrol and with antibiotics, and is improving nicely. He is extubated and has begun to eat. \n\nDiabetes was diagnosed 14 years ago. He was treated with pioglitazone 45 mg qd, metformin 2000 mg in divided doses and a sulfonylurea until February of this year, when the sulfonylurea was replaced with insulin. For convenience with his travel schedule, his insulin has been 70/30 administered by pen, with 30 U before breakfast and 40 U before  supper. He tests his BS before  breakfast and supper only and reports that, since he has been more careful with his diet recently, they have been in the low 100   s and mid 100   s, respectively. His hemoglobin A1c was 7.4 % a month ago.\nRetinopathy:\tHe is due for his yearly appointment with his ophthalmologist. No retinopathy in the past.  \nNephropathy:\tBUN/Cr 31/1.3 today. No microalbumin/creatinine ratio in CAS.\nNeuropathy:\tHe has occasional paresthesias in his feet.\nCardiac:\tHe is s/p stent for coronary artery disease about 8-9 years ago.\nVascular:\tNo claudication.\n\nHis IPF is treated with Mucomyst and gamma interferon, which he administers to himself. \n\nPast Medical History:  \nSurgery:\tCoronary stent\n\tLung biopsy at time of diagnosis of IPF \nMedical:\tHypertension\t\n\tHyperlipidemia\n\tGERD\nAllergies:\tNo known drug allergies.\nSmoking History:\tNo\nAlcohol History:\tNo\n\nFamily History:  \nThere is a significant family history of diabetes, including his mother, maternal grandmother, one of his 5 siblings, and some paternal relatives as well.\n\nSocial History: \nLives with his wife and their adopted son, who is a Recruitment Officer.\nComputer and Network Technicians for General Dynamics, covering 8 states. His job entails travel.\n\nReview of Systems: above\nEars: Mild hearing loss. \nReview of systems is otherwise negative.\n\nPhysical Exam:\t\nVery pleasant, ruddy complexioned man in no distress.\nBP:   148/78\t\tP:   76, regular\tT: 98.0\nWt:   209 by history\t\tHt: 5    7.5    by history\nHEENT:\tAnicteric. Full EOM's. \nFundi:\tNot examined.\nCarotids:\tNormal pulses, without bruits\nThyroid:\tNot palpable\nChest:\tFew rales anteriorly, L>R.\nHeart:\tNormal S1; physiologic S2.  No gallops.  No murmurs\nAbdomen:\tNo hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness. No palpable AAA. \nExtremities:\tNo edema.  DP 2+ R, absent L. PT 2+,=.  Good foot care.\nNeurological:\tAJ 1+,=, with normal relaxation. \n\nImpressions and Plan:\t\n59 year old man with type 2 diabetes now on steroids for IPF flare, currently down to 125 mg q12h, given at noon and MN.\nHaving reviewed his recent data, would suggest that we change his current insulin to:\nNPH 40 / Regular 10+ scale qAM before  breakfast\nRegular 10+ scale qPM before  supper\nNPH 30 at bedtime\nQID Regular sliding scale\nThese initial doses will need to be adjusted based on experience and on any changes in the steroid doses.\nI have no objection to resuming his pioglitazone, or substituting rosiglitazone while he is here, as long as you do not feel that volume overload is playing any role in his deterioration.\nI would prefer not to resume the metformin while is at risk for acute respiratory deterioration with risk of acidosis.\nWould change the steroid dosing to 8AM, 8 PM, hoping that we can also start to reduce the doses, PM first, if possible.\nHe appears to have an anemia that has at least a component of iron deficiency. If you agree, would start iron repletion. (Note that in addition to the iron studies, his MCV, though still normal, has come down over time.)\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNicholas Q.

Mr. Horn was most recently admitted from 12/11/94 through 12/30/94 for complaints of severe fatigue and dyspnea, although without symptoms of infection or acute graft rejection. His main complaint was generalized weakness and fatiguability even w/ very minimal activity.  Additionally, he reported a very poor appetite and continued weight loss. \n\nDuring that admission, he was transfused to a Hct&gt;30 and his PFTs ultimately returned back to baseline.  His weakness was felt to be primarily related to his malnutrition as he was documented as having an inadequate caloric intake. Nutrition was consulted, a PEG tube was placed and tube feeds were started to supplement his nutrition. He was discharged without incident on 12/30.\n\nThe patient continued w/ Nepro boluses and nocturnal TF at home and demonstrated an 8 lb weight gain in less than 2 months. He was improving until blood work revealed a positive CMV antigenemia (7 cells) on 1/29/95.  Transplant ID was consulted and the patient was restarted on Valcyte 450 QOD, and then later bumped up to QD dosing based on ID recommendations. He again experienced myelosuppression and was started on neupogen 300 mcg sc qd on 2/14/95 for a WBC of 0.6. At that time is HCT was 24.8 and PLTs 32K.  \n\nA repeat CBC was obtained today and revealed worsening myelosuppression; Hct 21.6/Hgb 6.9, WBC 0.4 and PLTs 15K.   Case was discussed with Dr. Valerio and the patient was contacted and instructed to present to the BCC ER for further evaluation and treatment.  \n\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n   1. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (pathology consistent with UIP), first\ndiagnosed in 2090.\n2. Obstructive sleep apnea.\n3. Coronary artery disease.\n4. Type 2 diabetes.\n5. GERD.\n6.

After stent placement she was discharged to rehab, and then \n\nreturned to the emergency room complaining of severe sudden onset of \n\nright lower quadrant pain.  CT scan of the abdomen showed cecal \n\nthickening with fat stranding locally.  She subsequently was taken to \n\nthe operating room.  Her postoperative course was uncomplicated and she \n\nwas discharged to Hendry Hospital where she had remained until May.\n\n \n\nHer complaints today include some constipation, which she is relating \n\nto iron intake.  She is going to use some stool softeners and some milk \n\nof magnesia for this.  She also has some diaphoresis at nighttime, \n\nwhich she reports has occurred prior to her hospitalization.  \n\n \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise, today she denies fever, chills, chest \n\npain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, \n\nor calf pain.\n\n \n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: On physical exam she is healthy appearing in no apparent \n\ndistress.  She is accompanied today by her daughter.  Her weight is 164 \n\npounds.  Her vital signs are 103/80, 70, 16, 96.6.  Her abdomen is \n\nsoft, nontender and nondistended.

Ms. Etheridge has a history of coronary artery disease, stating that she has a    heart problem.     She is unable to give more details at the present time.  Per old records, she carries the diagnosis of CAD and diastolic heart failure EF 55%.  \n\n\tShe was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission, when she began to complain of    a cold.     She felt chills, even though it was warm in her house.  That day she suffered a mechanical fall, slipping on a blanket in her home.  She hit her left eye, but denies LOC.  The next day, she was    achy    all over, noted a dry cough, and was    wheezy.     The day prior to admission, she states that she    couldn't breath    and had to come into the ER.\n\nOn arrival to WGH at 11:30AM 01/18/88 vitals were: P 93  BP 121/82  RR 22  96% on room air.  She had a prolonged ER course of 31 hours duration.  Initially, she was treated for presumed COPD flare with nebulizers, prednisone and doxycycline.  A rapid flu test was positive for influenza A.  She received 1 liter of normal saline.  Approximately 6 hours later, she complained of 7/10 mid sternal chest pain, non-radiating.  EKG showed: sinus tachycardia @115bpm, with STE 1mm AVR, and STD II, V3-V5.  Her pain came to 1/10 with 2L NTG and Ativan.  Small doses of IV lopressor were given.  STDs partially resolved.  Around 10AM the day of admission  (01/19/88) her blood pressure acutely rose to 190 systolics, her heart rate increased to 106bpm.  Per the patient, she remembers having a coughing fit, and being unable to catch her breath.  She was placed on CPAP, then switched to BiPAP for ABG: 125/78/7.13.  She was felt clinically to be in flash pulmonary edema.  She was treated with nebulizers, intravenous TNG, lasix and BiPAP.  With improvement in hemodynamics, her pain and shortness of breath improved.  Enzymes were drawn and showed: trop 0.22, CK 122, MB 11.7.  She was started on heparin, integrillin (though unclear if she received it).\n\nThe patient currently denies pain.  She is extremely anxious, refusing blood draws, etc.\n\n\t\t\n\nPAST MEDICAL:\n\n1.\tCAD\n\n2.\tCHF - EF 55%,    diastolic failure    per old discharge summary.\n\n3.\tCOPD\n\n4.\tDM\n\n5.\tHTN\n\n6.\tPVD - s/p Left CEA, Right CEA, aortobifem bypass, bilateral femoral angioplasties, and a SMA stent.\n\n\n\nMEDICINES: Patient claims she takes pills for    sugar, angina, 2-3 meds for hypertension, etc.  Per list recorded in ED:\n\n1.\tPlavix 75mg PO qd\n\n2.\tglucotrol 2.5 mgpO qd\n\n3.\tZocor 20mg PO qd\n\n4.\tProtonix 40mg PO qd\n\n5.\tSennakot, colace\n\n6.\tIron sulfate\n\n7.\tMVI\n\n8.\tLisinopril 2.5mg PO qd\n\n9.\tlopressor 50mg PO BID\n\n10.\tXanax 0.25 mg PO prn\n\n11.\tDiluadid prn\n\n12.\tTylenol\n\n\n\nALLERGIES: \n\n1.\tSulfa (Bactrim)\n\n2.\tPCN, Ceftriaxone\n\n3.\tHCTZ\n\n4.\tCodeine, percocet\n\n5.\tZoloft\n\n6.\tAzithro\n\n\n\nSOCIAL: 1-2 drinks per day.

Pt reports she has had a bladder infection off and on for the past several months manifesting as urinary urgency, frequency, dysuria. Went to WGH Pecos clinic 1 wk pta and received fosfamycin. Went back on Tue w no resolution of sx and says med was changed (? to nitrofurantoin per ED pass-off). On Friday AM, woke up with sob. Felt bloated in her stomach and had difficulty w breathing when trying to get dressed. Sob much worse w activity, would resolve w lying down, associated w diaphoresis. Pt denies CP at the time of the episode (reports some subsequent short-lived R-sided CP in WGH ED, similar to R-sided CP she has had    off and on for awhile    wh she did not mention to the ED staff). Denies palpitations, arm or jaw pain. Denies increase in LE edema, no recent change in meds, excellent medication regimen compliance, not a lot of salt in diet, and no recent diet changes. Pt does sleep on mult pillows but says she does this because of her reflux disease. Pt does think she had similar sob 1-2  yrs ago when she was admitted to WGH, told she had CHF, and was diuresed. Because of her symptoms on Friday 12/09/88, pt went into WGH Pecos clinic. Per Pecos note, EKG at that time showed ST depressions in I,aVL, V5, V6, II/III/aVF. Pt received ASA 325 and lasix 40 mg IV, and was sent to WGH ED.\n\n\n\nED Course: On arrival to WGH ED, pt had VS T 98.2, P 74, BP 160/70, RR 24, O2 Sat 95% RA. Pt's EKG was read as showing ST depressions in V4-V6. Pt received NTG sl x 1, lopressor IV 5 mg x1, lopressor 25 mg po x1, and reportedly EKG changes improved w rate control. CXR in ED was clear.

Pt has been undergoing treament for persistent UTI. While sob is likely multifactorial from CHF and COPD, COPD exacerbated by recent illness is most likely etiology.  CHF is argued against by: normal BNP (especially in comparison to elevated BNP in 6000s on prior admission for CHF), clear CXR, clear lung exam, and pt is still having exertional CP similar to what she felt on AM of admission.  If one believes her EKGs demonstrated ischemic changes, this would support an explanation that her sob is an anginal equivalent. However, ST changes appear minimal on close evaluation of EKG changes. Cardiac enzymes are negative so far.\n\n\n\nPlan: \n\n1.\tSOB\n\na.\tCont to cycle cardiac enzymes.

He has been feeling pretty well though he is\n\ndistressed at his 18-pound weight gain.  His sugars were in the 300s before starting\n\nthe insulin.  Since he started the insulin, his sugars have come down nicely.  His\n\nfasting sugars have been in the 120s.  His afternoon sugars have been in the 70-90s. \n\nHe had a few hypoglycemic episodes early on but has not had some in almost a\n\nmonth.  Other than that, he really has no new complaints.  He is still not smoking. \n\nHe is still on the patch.  His neuropathy has not gotten any worse and he thinks he\n\ncan stop the Neurontin now.  He has not had any shortness of breath, cough or\n\nedema.\n\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As above.  No GI symptoms, no GU symptoms and no\n\nnew skin symptoms, no arthritic complaints. \n\n\n\nHABITS: Not smoking or drinking.  Not getting much exercise now.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: His blood pressure is 140/80 on the left, 150/80 on the right. \n\nHis pulse is 76 and regular.  Respirations are 16.  Lungs are clear. Heart: Regular\n\nrate and rhythm, negative M/R/G.  No bruits heard.  Nasopharynx unremarkable. \n\nAbdomen is benign.  He has diminished pulses but good capillary refill in the feet. \n\nThe cellulitis on the left ankle is completely resolved.  He has some neuropathy of\n\nthe feet with decreased sense to vibration in both feet, but his sensation to\n\nmonofilament is intact on both feet. \n\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \n\n\n\n(1)  Diabetes.  Will check his hemoglobin A1c today.  It may still be a little bit\n\n     high as he has undergone a rather brisk change since starting his insulin.  I\n\n     encouraged him to check his sugars a couple times a week, especially in the\n\n     afternoon.  If he continues to get low sugars, will cut back on his morning\n\n     insulin to 35 units.  He is going to bring in a form for custom shoes given his\n\n     neuropathy and is followed closely by Podiatry.  He had an eye exam earlier\n\n     this year with Dr. Yousif.\n\n\n\n(2)  Hypertension.  Will increase his Mavik to 4 mg a day.\n\n\n\n(3)  Hyperlipidemia.  Recheck lipids and SGOT today.\n\n\n\n(4)  CAD prevention.  He can't take aspirin so we will start Plavix 75 mg a day.\n\n\n\n(5)  Status-post splenectomy.  He needs a Pneumovax booster 0.5 cc was given in\n\n     the left deltoid.\n\n\n\n\n\nScott Phipps, M.D.\n\n\n\nSP/irons/quang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Decreased pulses in the feet and decreased capillary refill\nand decreased sensation of vibration and fine touch.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \n\n(1)  Diabetes.  Will check his hemoglobin A1c to see where we stand.  Continue\n     on his current regimen.  Encouraged him to increase his exercise and watch his\n     diet.  He has an eye exam scheduled.  His feet look okay, though we will have\n     to be careful given his neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease.\n\n(2)  Claudication.  Once again, talked to Mr. Vines about the absolute\n     importance of quitting smoking.  He is going to try using the Wellbutrin.  Gave\n     him a prescription for #60.  He will take one a day for 3-4 days and then go\n     up to 1 p.o. b.i.d.  He has no contraindications. I also encouraged him to use\n     the patch.  Hopefully, we will be able to get him off the cigarettes.  I also\n     encouraged him to walk until it hurts at least 3-4 x a day to try and train his\n     legs.\n\n(3)  Hypertension.  Our goal is to get his blood pressure down about 130.  Will\n     increase the Mavik to twice a day.\n\n(4)  Hyperlipidemia.  Well controlled on Lipitor.  Recheck his lipids.\n\n(5)  Neuropathy.  Stable.  He doesn't feel the need for any medication for it.\n\n(6)  HPDP.  Will check his guaiac cards.  He is not interested in a sigmoidoscopy. \n     He has had a Pneumovax.  Patient will follow up with me in 3 months. \n\n  \n\nScott Phipps, M.D.\n\nSP/irons/quang\n\n\n\n\n",

He describes his claudication as bilateral shin pain which radiates up to his knees.  His symptoms have worsened over the past two to three years and are now limiting his lifestyle.  He is able to walk approximately two to three city blocks when the pain starts and is relieved with rest.  He denies rest symptoms.  He was recently evaluated by Dr. Curtis Cochran for his claudication syjmptoms.

She is \ncurrently maintained on furosemide 20 mg. PO q.d., nifedipine XL 90 mg. PO \nq.d., and potassium chloride 10 ml. equivalents PO q.d.  Patient comes in \ntoday for a routine follow up of her blood pressure, as well as routine \nbaseline examinations.  On her last visit, her blood pressure was 160/90, \nand on check today it was 150/90.  We discussed the possibility that she \ncontinue her salt-restricted diet.  We also discussed that she continue \nher own exercise, both of which she does faithfully, and we also discussed \nthe possibility of her trying to gradually lose weight.  She currently \nweighs 199 lbs. and stands approximately 4'9\" tall.  \n \nAs far as long-term prognosis, my current plan is to evaluate her blood \npressure on another subsequent visit in the next 6-8 weeks and at that \ntime if it is elevated, we will consider either going up on her nifedipine \nXL dose or going up on her furosemide medicine, seeing if we can possibly \ngain some better control or possibly adding another agent.  However, at \nthis point she seems to be doing much better with this new blood pressure \nand this is significant improvement maintenance from her previous blood \npressure on her first admission, which was systolic blood pressures in the \n200s-190s.\n \n \nHer family situation which was somewhat unstable at her first presentation \nnow appears to be much more stable.  She is currently living with her \nmother and she says that she she is enjoying her new sense of feeling good \nabout her self with regard to exercise and maintenance of her diet.  \n \nPHYSICAL EXAM:  BP: 150/90   Lungs: clear bilaterally.  Heart: RRR, no \nmurmurs.  Abdomen: distended, obese, no evidence of HSM or any focal \ntenderness.  She had good pulses distally with no evidence of trace \nswelling bilaterally at the ankles.   Breast exam: no evidence of masses \nor lumps.\n \nShe will follow up with me in 6-8 weeks, at which time she will have a \nmammogram performed as well as a Pap smear, cholesterol test, and stool \nguaiacs.  Advance directives were not discussed and it is not a pertinent \nissue at this point. \n \n \n_________________________\nQuinton Lovett, M.D.\n \nEF:AW:0810\nDD:1-31-75\nDT:2-01-75\nDV:1-31-75\n ******** Approved but not reviewed by Attending Provider ********\n\n\n\n\n",

Patient appears to be doing fine. She has been compliant with her \nantihypertensive regimen, which consists of nifedipine and also \nhydrochlorothiazide. Since our last meeting, the patient has lost \napproximately 15 to 20 pounds. She has been exercising on a daily basis \nand eating very well, both of which have had very, very significant and \nbeneficial results on her blood pressure and pressure today on examination \nwas 120/80 in both arms. The patient was complaining of some ankle \nswelling, and in looking through her medicines I noted that she had been \non furosemide, which was a holdover from the time of her most recent \nadmission. I quickly switched to furosemide to hydrochlorothiazide, which \nI feel would give her much better diuretic response and relief of her \nsymptoms over the next few days. \n \nThe final issue with the patient today is low back pain, which she has had \nchronically for the last several years after suffering a fall in 2065. We \nhave tried a whole host of conservative measures, which have included bed \nrest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and back exercises. The \npatient is referred now to the Paoli Memorial Hospital Spinal Clinic for \nservices to obtain further help, and hopefully treatment, of her pain. \nTreatment recommendations from the Spinal Clinic will be forthcoming. \nPatient is scheduled to follow up with me again in two to three months.\n \nADDENDUM: The issue of her annual screening was addressed also and patient \nagreed to have her cholesterol checked today, but does not want to have \neither a mammogram or a Pap smear. She complains that she does not have \nfaith in these procedures and that this is something that she is not used \nto and does not want to have done. I attempted to discuss the need and why \nit is necessary to undergo continued screening and will continue to do \nthis with the patient in the future, but for now, the patient adamantly \nrefuses either of the two examinations. \n \n \n \n_________________________\nQuinton Lovett, M.D. \n \npu:ZT:1220/0612\nDD:8-23-76\nDT:8-24-76\nDV:8-23-76\n ******** Approved but not reviewed by Provider ********\n\n\n\n\n",

The PRESENTING COMPLAINT, HISTORY OF PRESENTING \nCOMPLAINT, PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, MEDICATIONS, ALLERGIES, SOCIAL \nHISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, and REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted on the \nrecord by Dr. Uehara, and as reviewed with the patient and with Dr. \nUehara.  Briefly, the patient is a pleasant 64-year-old woman, who \nhas had episodes of severe left-sided pressure-like chest pain off \nand on through the course of this week.  This has occurred with \nexertion and has always cleared with rest.  She is pain-free at \npresent, but presents to the Emergency Department because she \nreported to her family that she had ceased taking her high blood \npressure medications. \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The physical examination is as noted by Dr. \nUehara.  Basically, the examination is completely normal with the \nexception of the blood pressure, which ranges from 220 to 230 over \n100 to 110.  The patient's electrocardiogram does not show acute \nchanges. \nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  The cardiac troponin I is 0.53. \nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  I concur with Dr. Uehara that the \npatient has a strong history for unstable angina.  The patient will \nbe admitted to the hospital for further evaluation.  She has \nremained pain-free while in the Emergency Department and has \nreceived nitroglycerin paste.  Her blood pressure will be treated \nwith initiation of an ACE inhibitor. \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Unstable angina. \nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is \nadmitted to the hospital in satisfactory condition. \n___________________________________                    IZ329/1982 \nSTEPHEN X.

He has a hx of prostate CA diagnosed in 2059 at the BNH and had an RRP shortly thereafter at the BNH. Apparently his pathology showed extraprostatic extension and he received postop XRT. Apparently, he has remained disease free since this time until a PSA was checked this past October which was 3.53. He states that he had not had his PSA checked for a few years before this, admittedly perhaps because he had missed appointments. The Urologists at the BNH have since checked a bone scan and abdominal CT scan, all of which were negative. He has the reports here with him. The bone scan does show an abnormality at L5, but with data from plain films this appears to not be consistent with a met lesion. He also has had recurrent problems with bleeding from hemorrhagic radiation cystitis. This occurs once every few months or so and is not currently bothering him. He states that he is scheduled to have a cystoscopy at the BNH next week, however, is unsure if he has had a urine cytology done.\n\n\n\n\n\nImpression: In reviewing the patient's limited records that he brings and his history, it appears that he has had the appropriate care at the BNH. I have reassured him of this, and have indicated that he should just make sure that a urine cytology is also checked and that a repeat PSA be performed in the near future. I also informed him that he will likely need anti-androgen therapy in the future for further treatment of his prostate CA. He may follow up with me if he has questions in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuinton H. Welch, MD\n\nUrology - Laurens Memorial Hospital\n\nBerkley Medical School\n\n782-010-9623\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He underwent radical prostatectomy in 2061 and salvage XRT in 2062.  His care was at BNH and we don't have his XRT records.  The patient recalls 37 treatments.   The patient was well until he had an elevated PSA of 3.52 in 10/75.  He underwent a bone scan in 11/75 showing worrisome uptake at L5. In 1/76 he had a PSA of 17.46.  He has also developed lower back pain requiring MS Contin for pain control.  His course was complicated by a possible bladder/urethral infection.  He is incontinent from his surgery.  In 2/76 he had a cystoscopy which revealed nodules in the bladder (TCC vs. prostatic scar/inflammation).  \nThe patient's LLP worsened.   He reports occasional severe shooting pain that lead to gait imbalance.  On the day of presentation, he experienced severe acute back pain while getting out of bed.  The pain was so intolerable that he asked his daughter to bring him to the emergency room. Just before arrival to the ED he developed stridor, in his words he was    sucking air in and out.     ENT was consulted in the ED and determined that he had a limited glottic gap, and that the acute stridor was most likely secondary to anxiety and increased air flow through a restricted glottic opening, recommending humidified air by shovel air mask, steroids, and outpatient followup.  MRI of the lumbar spine showed metastatic disease involving of the L4 vertebral body, extending into the pedicles, both L4-5 neural foramina, and the prevertebral soft tissues.  No compression of the thecal sac.\n\nMr. Quin reports improved pain since admission.  He still has some pain when moving from one position to anther.  he denies fecal incontinence, saddle anesthesia, LE weakness or paresthesia.  He would like to be cared at the LMH from now on.  The patient had an oncologist from BNH but does not remember his name.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  \nProstate Ca (history per HPI)\nHTN\nPVD\nED\nType 2 DM on oral agent\nVocal cord polyp excision in 2064\nH/o COPD\n \nMEDICATIONS:  \nBicalutamide 50 mg po qd\nGlyburide 10 mg po qd\nHCTZ 12.5 mg po qd\nMS Contin 30 mg bid\nMorphine 15 mg po q4h\nSenna Colace and lactulose prn constipation\n \nALLERGIES: \nNKDA\n \nSOCIAL HISTORY: Notary.  CPA and lives with wife in Tonganoxie.\nHabits:  60 pack year smoking history\nPast heavy alcohol consumption but none now\n                                                                                                                                           PHYSICAL EXAM:  \nGeneral: Well-appearing, in no acute distress.  \nHEENT: PERRL.  EOMI.  Oropharynx is clear.  \nNeck: Supple \nLymph nodes: No cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  \nCardiac: S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  \nChest: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.  \nAbdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, with positive bowel sounds.  old midline surgical scars.\nExtremities:  Well perfused with no edema. No bony pain to palpation.\nNeurologic:  CN II-XII grossly intact with no focal neurologic deficits. 5/5 LE strength, movements limited by pain.  normal gait.  toes down bilaterally\nGU: no penial or testicular abnormalities.  +pads\n\nIMPRESSION and PLAN:   \n74 y/o gentleman with metastatic prostate cancer, new L4 metastasis and pain.  The patient's LBP is likely due to his spine met.  Based on the MRI results, his symptoms and his exam we believe he is an appropriate candidate for palliative radiotherapy to his L-spine.  I discussed with Mr. Quin the likely cause of his pain.  We then discussed the treatment options.  Mr. Quin would like to undergo a course of palliative radiotherapy to relieve his pain.  We will simulate (plan) the patient's XRT tomorrow am, with a treatment to follow on the same day.  All of the patient's questions were answered to his satisfaction.  We would also recommend an GU oncology consultation regarding the patient's ADT and other possible systemic therapies.  The patient only had L-spine MRI, a bone scan may be of benefit to establish the extent of metastatic disease.\n\nQuenton Zacharie Odell, MD\nQuanita Ziemer, MD\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\nRecord date: 2076-05-04\n\n\n\nReason for Visit\n\npatient is here to establish primary care\n\nHe has metastatic prostate cancer and has completed 12 cycles of radiation to the back with good effect. Last PSA was 1.7.  Is receiving Lupron every 3 months (after his 6 weeks pf Casodex).;\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness\n\nMr. Quin presented in 2061 with a PSA of around 4 and a prostate cancer of unknown clinical grade. Radical retropubic prostatectomy was performed in the BNH system, and disease extended beyond the prostate to the margins of the resection and into the seminal vesicle. In early 2062 he received adjuvant radiation. His PSA remained undetectable throughout the 2060s, but was troubled by a great deal of radiation cystitis with hematuria, frequency, and dysuria. In addition, he was totally incontinent. In 2071 his PSA was undetectably low.   \n\nOver the last 8 months, he has developed low back pain of progressively increasing severity. His PSA back in September 2075 was approximately 3 and when checked in November was 17. Early this year his pain was of great severity, and repeat CT scans and bone scans were performed. Destructive disease was seen in the body of L4 with foraminal encroachment. The thecal sac and the cauda quina were, however, intact. He was started in early February on bicalutamide and was scheduled to have a Zoladex injection, but his pain became more and more severe, and ultimately he was admitted to the LMH last week where I first met him. Since admission he was started on urgent radiotherapy and has completed 12 cycles of radation with a last PSA of 1.7.  He is due for Lupron injection on 6/13/76 at which time a PSA will be checked.\n\nHis oncologist Dr. Leblanc has helped him wean the MS Contin and tried to start adding low dose gabapentin as a narcotic sparing agent for presumed neuropathic pain.  He is not requiring his prn pain meds very often.\n\nHe has claudication.\n\nHe has symmetric leg edema worse right after lupron injection and improved with TEDS.  No chest symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n\nProblems\n\n      Prostate cancer\n\nPlan as above\n\n      Claudication    : has buttock pain when walking which resolves when stopping.  He has decreased pulses in his DPs bilaterally and has a h/o smoking and diabetes.\n\n      Diabetes mellitus type 2\n\nchecks his sugars infrequently.  He is on glyburide 10 am 5 pm.  He had his eyes checked by an opthalmologist recently and no evidence of retinopathy was present. He has no early satiety, blurry vision, polyuria polydipsia, foot ulcers, chest pain, shorteness of breath, but does have some claudication.  He is not on an ACE- inhibitor, takes HCTZ for BP control and has had hematuria from aspirin.\n\n\n\nPast Medical History\n\nas above\n\nsee CAS note\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily History\n\nsee CAS\n\n\n\nSocial History\n\nSee cas\n\n\n\nHabits\n\nhe has stopped smoking. good social support\n\n\n\nReview of Systems\n\nPositives noted in problem list.  Otherwise negative in detail.\n\n\n\nVital Signs\n\n      BLOOD PRESSURE   150/93 \n\n      PULSE   65 \n\n      RESPIRATORY RATE   12 \n\n      WEIGHT   202 lb\n\n\n\nPhysical Exam\n\nGeneral: Well appearing walking much better with his cane.\n\n\n\nSkin: No rashes.\n\n\n\nHEENT: NC/AT.  EOMs intact.  PERRL B.  VA OD [] OS [].  Hearing grossly intact.  TMs clear B.  OP clear without exudate.\n\n\n\nNeck: Supple, FROM.  No thyromegaly or nodules.  2+ carotids B without bruits.  No LAD.\n\n\n\nChest: CTA B.  No wheeze, rales.\n\n\n\nCor: JVP 4 cm.  Nl S1, S2.  No S3, S4, murmurs.\n\n\n\nAbdomen: +BS.  Soft, ND/NT.  No HSM.\n\n\n\nBack: No spinous process tenderness or CVAT.\n\n\n\n\n\nExt: No cyanosis, clubbing but has mild bilateral ankle edema.\n\nDecreased pulses in DP and PT but good capillary refill\n\nNo charcots joints or ulcers in his legs or feet\n\nNo cords or calf pain on palpation\n\n \n\nStocking glove sensory neuropathy to vibration temperature and proprioception\n\nreflexes are normal\n\n\n\n\n\nMedications\n\nGlycuride 10am 5 pm\n\nHctz 12.5 mg po qd\n\nColace TID\n\nMSCOntin 30 mg am 30 pm with Morphine 15 mg q4h for breakthough but not needing it.\n\nPrilosec 40\n\nGabapentin Just restarted 100 mg po tid\n\n\n\n\n\nDisposition and Plans\n\n1. Pain- I think he has a component of neuropathic pain.  I think that we will start low dose neuronitni 100 tid for 7 days, he will email me about how his pain is and we will cut his pm MScontin in half if we can.  I do not want to have to use exteremely high doses of gabapentin to spare narcotics because he is not a drug seeker and I want him to be comfortable and he has no congnitive problems with safe adminstration or dosing.  His PSA is low and will continue to follow.  If his pain is at night which sometimes it is, he could have a component of restless legs from arterial insufficiency, will check PVRs anyway to rule that out\n\n2. Cluadication- check PVRs, most likely has bilateral iliofemoral disease. He does not want to take aspirin given hiematuria in the past. I will broach this issue next time again\n\n3. DM- will email me his sugars and will adjust oral agents as necessary,. He needs U/a for microalb, eas encourgagd to wear shoes in house, will check PVrs, will start low dose lisinopril for BP and prevention of diabetic nephropathy and heck creatinine and K one week after starting the medicaiton.  Will check lipids.  Will continue to monitor BP.  Will start aspirin when he is willing.\n\n \n\nPlan to follow up with patient by email\n\nwill see in clinic RTC in 3 months\n\n \n\nEddie Zajac MD 94212\n\nSeen w/ Dr. Alaniz who agrees with plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As part of a work-up for his prostate cancer, stress test was performed on 6/30/76.  Myocardial scans showed old inferolateral MI with mild ischemia.  EF was 50%.

He lives with his wife.  \n\n\n\n\t\t\tReview of systems:\n\n   Due to back pain, his physical activity is pretty much limited.  He quit smoking in 1/76.\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n\t\t\t\n\n-BMI: 34.6  Obese, high risk\n\n-Pulse: 72  \n\n-height: 66  in.\n\n-weight: 214  lbs.\n\n-Neck:   JVP was not distended.

Myocardial scans showed only mild ischemia in the territory of the prior MI.  Since he is asymptomatic, I would continue medical therapy.  For some reason, he has not started Lipitor.  His LDL is markedly elevated.  My target LDL would be below 70.  For his myocardial protection, I have suggested that he increase the dose of Toprol from 25 mg. qd to 50 mg. qd.\n\n\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\n\t\t\t\n\nglyburide 10mgqam, 5 mg. qpm  po qd Start: 09/08/2076\n\nmetformin hydrochloride 500 mg  po bid Start: 09/08/2076\n\nlisinopril 10 mg  po qd Start: 09/08/2076\n\nToprol XL 25 mg  po qd Start: 09/08/2076\n\nLipitor 20mg  po qd Start: 09/08/2076\n\nPrilosec 40mg  po qd Start: 09/08/2076\n\ndocusate sodium 100 mg  po tid Start: 09/08/2076\n\nHCTZ 12.5 mg  po qd Start: 09/08/2076\n\nASA 81 mg  po qd Start: 09/08/2076\n\nfree text medications     morphine Start: 09/08/2076\n\ngabapentin 100mg  po tid Start: 09/08/2076\n\n\n\nDisposition:\n\nFollow-up in one year.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCC:   Eddie Zajac, M.D.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSigned electronically by   Freddie-Verne  Urie MD  on  Sep 13, 2076     \n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n",

Since that time, despite the administration of a variety of antihypertensives, her BP has rarely been normal and she insists that her BP is a function of having come to the doctor. In Mar. 2087 she was hospitlaized with acute congestive heart failure and Lasix was added to her regimen that included at that time Norvasc, Atacand and Atenolol.  Despite some peripheral edema, she continues on this regimen and says that she feels well.  She recently celebrated her 81st Birthday surround by her seven children, and multiple grand- and great-grand children. O: BP 170/80; Heart-- NSR wiohtout murmurs or gallopr.

She was T2 M1 N0.  She had been on Tamoxifen 10 mg. b.i.d. for 5 years, but this was d/c'd in March 2086 by Dr. Quy Cherry and she has had not sign of recurrence. She does, however, have a great deal of anxiety about the return of her malignancy and when her daughter found a \"lump\" in her back last week in the course of giving her a massage, she became convinced that her cancer had returned.O:  Well-healed L modified radical mastectomy.  No axillary notes noted.  R breast appears normal.  Pt. gets routine mammograms on the R breast. No lumps or masses were found in or on her back. Chest X-ray today shows no nodular densities.A:  S/P left radical mastectomy for ca. of the breast, with no evidence of recurrence. P:  No further therapy indicated, but Alk. Phos. drawn along with routine chemistries.\n\n\n\n\n\nReview of Systems\t\n\nPatient says that she gets short of breath while climbing up stairs, and cannot walk more than a block or two without getting shortness of breath.  She always has edema in both legs, except when she arises in the a.m. at which time her legs are free of edema.  At the same time, she denies PND and says that she sleeps on only one pillow. She denies chest pain, says that she eats well and has regular BMs.  Her biggest complaint now is urinary pressure and urgency.  She had been using a Pessary for Uterine decensus, but it was removed by Gyn and she was prescribed local Estrogen cream, which has not yet helped.  She was advised to call Gyn for another visit, since she was scheduled about 6 weeks from now.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedications\t  \n\nATENOLOL\t 25MG 2 Tablet(s) PO QAM\n\nquinine\t 260MG PO x1\n\nLASIX (FUROSEMIDE)\t 40MG 1 Tablet(s) PO BID\n\nNORVASC (AMLODIPINE)\t 5MG 1 Tablet(s) PO BID\n\nATACAND (CANDESARTAN)\t 32MG PO QD\n\nK-DUR (KCL SLOW REL.)\t 20MEQ 1 Tablet(s) PO QD\n\n\n\nVital Signs\t  \n\nPulse:\t 70   Regular\n\nHeight:\t 57   Inches\n\nWeight:\t 140   Pounds\n\nBlood Pressure:\t 170/80   Left Arm\n\n\n\nPhysical Exam\t  \n\n \n\nHEENT\t\n\nPupils react = to light.

Plavix was reloaded for 1 week in this setting.  She was discharged to a rehab facility in pauls valley 8/10/96 for PT/OT.  At the rehab facility she developed hematemesis and was admitted to the medicine service last night for UGIB.  She denies CP/SOB/N at present.  She does not have memory of the hematemesis episodes overnight.  She required some reorientation to the situation leading to her readmission.\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n   1. CAD:\n-s/p PCI of PDA 2089 for 99% lesion in setting of ACS, s/p PCI of 99% LAD lesion in 2090 also in setting of ACS, residual LV function normal w/o focal WMA in 2091.  Inferior STEMI 7/96 due to near occlusion of PLV resulting in BMS to PLV and mid RCA.\n2. HTN/Hypertensive heart disease: rather difficult to control HTN, needing multiple agents to achieve near normal to high normal pressures.  Had a good bp response to thiazides but caused unacceptable degree of hyponatremia.  BP also related to the degree of chronic low back pain, and was substantially better for 6 months after localized treatment.  Hypertensive HD manifest primarily as peripheral edema, worsened by norvasc, improved on diuretic.\n3. Dyslipidemia\n4. DMII\n5. Postherpetic neuralgia  \n6. Depression  \n7. Hemorrhoids  \n8. Osteoarthritis  \n9. h/o DVT /PE\n10. Breast CA  96 T2N1MO ER/PR+ Her2 neg breast CA s/p L radical mastectomy, XRT, and tamoxifen x 10 years  \n11. Recurrent UTI  \n12. Urinary incontinence \n13. History of HIT AB Positive 2090\n\n\n\tFamily history:\n   There is a history of non-premature cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease:  Her father died of a stroke in his 80s, her mother had congestive heart failure, and a brother had an MI.  Her other siblings have lived into their 80s.\n\n\n\tSocial history:\n   She has not smoked, and uses alcohol only rarely.  She lives at home with her youngest daughter, Vaccaro.  Another daughter, Tiffany, has been also very involved in her mother's care.\n\n\n\tReview of systems:\n   As above, otherwise negative in detail. \n\nPhysical examination:\n\t\n-Pulse: 58  \n-resp. rate:  16  \n-Abdomen:   soft NT and ND, no hepatosplenomegaly, no pulsatile masses.\n-Neuro:   a + oriented to self, needs orientation to location and context\n-Extremities:   trace lower extremity edema, 1+ bilat PT pulses, 2+ radial pulses\n-Chest:   cleart to auscultation anteriorly without crackles or wheezes\n-Neck:   JVP not elevated, no HJR, no carotid bruits\n-HEENT:   NC/AT, with mild ptosis of left eyelid from post herpetic changes\n-General appearance:   A WD, WN elderly woman in no acute distress. Answering questions propriately, but requiring reorientation.\n-BP: 155/60  \n\n\n\tEKG:\n   NSR, CRO old IMI, NSSTTWAs, no significant change\n\n\n\tImpression:\n   88 yo woman with extensive CAD history, HTN and DM2 recently started on oral agents, now presents with UGIB in setting of plavix extended reload of 150 QD x 1 week.\n\nAgree with reducing plavix to 75 QD for now in combination with low dose ASA.  Despite low level cardiac marker elevation there is little suggest an intercurrent coronary syndrome currently complicating the UGIB.  Would try to continue antiplatelet therapy for a minimum of 30 days, and preferably for 90 days in the setting of recently placed bare metal stents, if tolerable from a hemodynamic and hemostatic perspective.  Agree with switching to short term beta blocker, and holding lasix for now given apparent volume depletion.  Continue high dose statin, ARB, and low dose CCB for BP control.\n\nIf UGIB continues to stabilize would prefer to maintain on H2 blocker rather than PPI to limit interference with antiplatelet therapy with plavix.  \n\nWill follow with you.\n\n\t\nGeary A.

C-scope done. Needs f/u c-scope in 6 mos. \n\nColonic polyps : tubular adenomas.\n\nOsteoarthritis : knees\n\n\n\nHealth Care Proxy : Forms in paper chart. Son Roger Yearwood is health care proxy and has power of attorney.\n\nCODE STATUS : Full code, but would not want continuation of heroic measures if \"there is no reasonable expectation of recovery from physical disability.\" LIving Will and Testament in her paper chart. \n\n\n\nPatient is here for follow-up.\n\n\n\n1. CAD.  Patient admitted to the hospital in middle of November after she presented with pulmonary edema.  Ruled in for an MI and subsequent cardiac catheterization showed three vessel disease and she underwent three vessel CABG.  Postoperative course relatively smooth although she had been postoperative pneumothorax and had a chest tube which was only needed briefly.  Patient did quite well and was discharged to her daughter's home approximately 1 week after her surgery.  Prior to her surgeries there was a brief episode where patient was confused and was having trouble speaking, a neuro consultation was called, a CVA was ruled out and it appeared patient may have had changes secondary to medications.  Has not had any further recurrence of these symptoms.\n\n\n\nSince her discharge patient has been doing quite well, no complaints of any chest pain, gets a little bit short of breath after exerting herself for a while but this is secondary to lack of conditioning and comes on gradually and results quickly as she rests.  Has more energy, had previously asked for a walk of a core she felt weak and now does not feel the need for this.  Also had had some lower extremity edema and this has now resolved.  Reports compliance with her new medical regimen with no untoward effects.  She was discharged to home without aspirin.  Patient followed by Dr. Nesbitt and has a follow-up appointment with him end of January, also has follow-up appointment with cardiothoracic surgery.\n\n\n\n2.  Gastric ulcer.  Patient had a gastric ulcer last July, biopsy without any evidence of malignancy and no evidence of H. pylori.  During recent hospitalization had a follow-up EGD which showed no evidence of continued disease.  Patient does report that for the past two nights she has woken up during the night with some stomach discomfort.  This seemed to have been relieved this morning by Prilosec.  Not using any NSAIDs.\n\n\n\nSocial History: Living with her daughter for the moment in Culpeper Colorado but hoping to move back to her own apartment in Adrian.\n\n\n\nPhysical Exam\n\n\n\nPatient is in no apparent distress.\n\nWeight: 114 pounds\n\nBlood Pressure: 114/56\n\nNeck: supple without thyroidomegaly, no lymphadenopathy.  Without JVD.\n\nLungs: Clear.\n\nCor. S1, S2 without gallops, rubs or murmurs.\n\nAbdomen: non-tender, without organomegaly. \n\nExtremities: without edema. \n\n\n\nAssessment and Plan\n\n\n\n1.  CAD.  Doing quite well, continue current regimen.  Patient to call if any new complaints or problems, recurrence of chest pain.  Will speak with Dr. Nesbitt regarding whether she should restart aspirin q.day, contact patient if recommendation is to restart.\n\n\n\n2.  Gastric ulcer.  Recent repeat EGD with no evidence of recurrent disease.  Now with some recurrence of epigastric pain.  For the moment she will increase omeprazole to 20 mg b.i.d. and take if this does for several weeks and then go back to previous dose.  If continues to have epigastric pain or needs higher dose of omeprazole will need further investigation.\n\n\n\nI will see her for follow-up in two months.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       Osvaldo Lilly, M.D.\n\n\n\nPlease excuse any transcription errors, typed with voice recognition technology.\n\n     \n\n\n\n",

She also has had a TAH and is on Premarin \nreplacement.  She has had only one prior visit in Internal Medicine one year ago with \nDr. Eric Olds, and since then has been seen for med refills by nurse \npractitioners.  She has had no specific complaints, has been relatively \ncompliant with her medicines although her understanding of her disease \nprocess appears to be limited.  She currently is taking Micronase 10 mg. a \nday, an aspirin a day, and Premarin .625 mg. a day.  She describes \nintermittent symptoms of hyperglycemia, although she follows her blood \nsugars with urine dipsticks and says that they have been running in the \nnon-detected range most often.  She has not had any new visual blurring, \nexcessive polydipsia or polyuria.  She has not been taking her Synthroid \nmedication for the past year since she last saw Dr. Olds, since she ran out \nof the medication.  She has made no effort to get a refill on this, and \nhas not noticed any significant difference.  She denies excessive fatigue, \npalpitations, constipation, or lethargy, yet she inquires today about \npotentially restarting this medicine.  She has no other specific \ncomplaints.  She has a good energy level.\n \nSocial History:  She works at Nvidia and lives with her son.\n \nAllergies:  None.\n \nHabits:  She does not drink.  She had quit smoking a year ago, but has \nbeen smoking this past week due to some stresses at home, and is planning \non stopping this.\n \nPhysical Exam:  Blood pressure 148/83.  Pulse 70 and regular.  HEENT exam \nreveals a palpable right thyroid lobe and an absent left thyroid lobe \nwithout specific nodularity or tenderness.  She has no adenopathy.  Her \noropharynx is clear.  Her chest is clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam:  \nregular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, without murmurs or rubs.  Her abdomen is \nobese, soft and non-tender.  She has abnormal pigmentation across her \nskin, including her palms and her soles of her feet, and no peripheral \nedema.\n \nAssessment/Plan:\n \n1)   Diabetes mellitus.  Will continue on Micronase 10 mg. a day, check a \n     hemoglobin A1C, and send her to the eye doctor.  We have talked about \n     good foot hygiene, and she will continue to check her urine \n     dipsticks.  \n \n2)   History of multinodular goiter.

She went 9 minutes and 11 seconds on a modified Bruce to \na maximum heart rate of 131, which was 81% of predicted.  She had 1mm \nand 2mm ST depressions, which was predictive of significant coronary \ndisease.  She continues to have chest pain only when she is exercising \nvigorously, which is rapidly walking.  She vehemently denies that she \nhas any chest pain at rest or with less exertion.\n \nWe began a discussion of what kind of intervention she might like to \nhave, and we will continue this over time, but currently she is not \ninterested in intervention if we can manage her medically.\n \nPLAN:  I will start her today on atenolol 25mg and on an aspirin.  She \nrefused nitroglycerine because she did not feel that she had any need \nfor taking it.  She will come back in one week to see how her pulse is \non atenolol.  \n \nToday blood pressure was 164/82 and her pulse was 80.  \n \nWe will increase the atenolol as tolerated.  I will continue to work \nwith her strenuously on risk factor modification.  Her other risk \nfactors include diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, though \nher cholesterol is current well controlled with an LDL of 95.  Her \ndiabetes is not as well controlled, and I think I will consider sending \nher to Olivia Orosco for further management of this.\n \nShe will return to see me in a week's time, and she understands that hip \nif she has increasing chest pain that she should call me or come to the \nhospital.\n \n \n \n_________________________\nPeggy Chaya Quebedeaux, M.D. \n \nCT:QG:8455\nDD:11-16-78 \nDT:11-18-78 \nDV:11-16-78 \n\n\n\n\n",

This was complicated by\n\nacute renal failure with creatinine between 1.6 and 2.4 and\n\nlabile sugars.  She was discharged to rehab on 04/19/2086 for\n\napproximately 1 month.  Subsequently, she developed left thigh\n\nerythema, swelling, and pain along the incision site yesterday. \n\nShe has had no fevers, nausea, or vomiting but has had difficulty\n\nambulating due to pain, denies any diarrhea but has had some mild\n\nstomach upset.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable as I said for hypertension,\n\ndiabetes, CHF, chronic renal insufficiency, peripheral vascular\n\ndisease, and hypothyroidism.  She had MIBI in 2084 with LAD and\n\nD1 lesion.  Her EF was 35%.  She had a CABG in 2083.\n\nSocial history, family history, and review of systems are as per\n\nthe written note.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Amitriptyline, atenolol, aspirin,\n\nhydrochlorothiazide, insulin, Lasix, lisinopril, Norvasc,\n\nSynthroid, Zocor, and Zoloft.\n\nALLERGIES:  None.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, in no\n\nacute distress, however, distinctly uncomfortable.  Vital signs: \n\nTemperature is 97.2, pulse 59, respiratory rate 20, blood\n\npressure 148/67, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.  For\n\nfull physical exam findings, please see the resident's written\n\nnote.  Specifically, HEENT, neck, abdominal exam, and neurologic\n\nexams are within normal limits as documented.  Respiratory exam\n\nreveals crackles at the bases but no respiratory distress. \n\nCardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm with 2/6 systolic\n\nejection murmur at the left upper sternal border. \n\nMusculoskeletal exam:  The fem-pop incision on the left leg is\n\nconcerning for purulent drainage along the incision site,\n\nespecially along the upper aspect of the upper thigh.  There is\n\napproximately an area of 8 x 5 cm of erythema, induration, and\n\ntenderness surrounding the area draining purulent material.  The\n\npatient also has a transmetatarsal amputation.  The wound there\n\nis clean, dry, and intact.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  CBC and electrolytes remarkable for white blood\n\ncount of 10.9, BUN and creatinine ratio of 30:1.4 respectively.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Surgery was consulted regarding\n\nthis likely wound infection.  Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and\n\nFlagyl were their request for antibiotics.  These were\n\nadministered in the Emergency Department, and the patient will be\n\nadmitted for likely operative debridement of this wound\n\ninfection.\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Postsurgical infection.\n\nSECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Diabetes.\n\nTERTIARY DIAGNOSIS:  Peripheral vascular disease.\n\nDISPOSITION:  Admitted.\n\n______________________________\n\nWALLACE, VELMA MD\n\nD: 07/19/86\n\nT: 07/19/86\n\nDictated By: WALLACE, VELMA\n\neScription document:2-8532294 BF\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He has had no complaints, since that time, and denies any stridor, wheezing, productive cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis or fever.  He has gained several pounds, but is otherwise feeling well.\n\nOn physical exam today, the patient appears quite well.  HEENT examination shows no JVD or thyromegaly.  He has no palpable cervical, supraclavicular or axillary adenopathy.  His blood pressure today is 130/88, with a regular heart rate and rhythm of 89.  S1 and S2 are within normal limits; and there is no murmur, rub or gallop.  His resting O2 saturation is 100% on room air, with a respiratory rate of 20 per minute.  His temperature is 98.6, and his weight is 232 pounds.  His chest is clear to auscultation and percussion, with good excursion and no change in tactile fremitus or egophony between the two hemithoraces.  Abdominal examination is benign.  I cannot appreciate any hepatosplenomegaly, and no other masses are identified.  He has no tenderness to palpation.  Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  His incisions are well-healed, and no nodules are appreciated.  \n\nThe chest x-ray today is unchanged, with no evidence of new nodules, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  His recent chest CT scan shows several stable parenchymal nodules and no evidence of recurrent lymphoma or carcinoid.\n\nIn summary, I am pleased to find Mr. Fredrick well, without evidence of recurrence.  The plan is to see him for follow-up in four months.  \n\nLarry T. Jansen, M.D.\n\nLTJ:lowery\n\n\nLarry T. Jansen, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n",

He is a 50-year-old man without symptomatic complaints.  He denies any stridor, wheezing, productive cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis or fever.  He had a recent chest CT scan which was of concern to him.\n\nOn physical exam today, the patient appears quite well.  HEENT examination shows no JVD or thyromegaly.  No supraclavicular, cervical or axillary adenopathy is noted.  His blood pressure today is 132/92, with a regular heart rate and rhythm of 86.

His temperature is 98.6, and his weight is 228 pounds.  Chest examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally to percussion and auscultatory examination.  He has good chest wall excursion and no evidence of wheezing.  He does not have any egophony.  His abdomen is soft, nondistended and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly; and his extremities show no evidence of edema, cyanosis or clubbing.  The surgical wound is well-healed.  There is no evidence of local recurrence.\n\nThe chest CT scan shows two small nodules that do not appear to have significantly changed given the correction for volume averaging. The area of his previous resection shows no suggestion of recurrence.\n\nIn summary, Mr. Fredrick has two small pulmonary abnormalities that are not particularly suggestive of recurrent disease.  I agree with Dr. Ordonez's plan to repeat the CT scan in four months.\n\n\nLarry T. Jansen, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n",

His symptoms started on Tuesday afternoon, three days ago, while working in the yard.  He describes substernal chest pressure that waxes and wanes in intensity, but has been constant since its onset.  It does not radiate.  It was associated with &#8220;gurgling&#8221; like &#8220;loose phlegm&#8221; in his chest at its onset, but this has since resolved.  It was worse while sitting in the car or leaning forward or backward, but not with twisting.  He has not had any recent URI symptoms.  Tylenol helps take the edge off of his discomfort.  He has been measuring his BP at home, and over the past few days it has ranged to 190/102 averaging 170/80.  He reports compliance with his medications without recent changes.  He has had worsened dyspnea on exertion, stating that he could walk 1+ miles one week ago, but could only manage 1/4 mile today.  He sleeps on two pillows with no changes, and he denies LE edema.  His anginal equivalent includes jaw and neck pain and mild substernal chest pressure without radiation to his arms; he states his current symptoms are not consistent with his angina.  \n\n\n\nHe called Dr. Upham, his cardiologist, and was told to increase his Lasix frequence to 20 mg BID.  He was encouraged to come to the SSH ED for his symptoms given his history of CAD (below).  On arrival, the vital signs were T 96.7, P 71, BP 166/81, RR 18, Sat 97% RA.  He had negative kiosk biomarkers and no EKG changes.  He received NTG x3 without much relief and ASA at home.  \n\n\n\nPAST CARDIOLOGICAL HISTORY\n\n- 1/07/05: SSCP (heaviness/squeezing) radiating to left arm/jaw with throat constriction (MSH); EKG: STD V3-V6, palpitations; CK peak 340, Troponin 7.8 (SSH) \n\n- 1/18/05: LHC (SSH): LAD mild, mLCX after OM1 severe, prox OM1 severe, mRCA severe, mild inferior hypokinesis, LVEF 50%, mLCX 2x12 mm Minivision, OM1 2x12 mm Minivision, mRCA 2.75x12 mm Minivision\n\n- 1/20/05: Echo (SSH): LA 44 LVIDd 47 PWT 11 IVS 11 LVEF 56%, ascending aorta 33 \n\n- 5/24/05: ETT (MSH): HR 75-142 (86% MPHR - on Toprol), BP 150/84-154/100, EKG: NSR, 8 minutes, no CP, no ischemia on stress\n\n- 9/07: ETT (Gordon Hospital): negative\n\n- 09/26/07: POD #2 s/p radical prostatectomy 8/10 CP at rest (mid sternal to neck/left shoulder with diaphoresis); called 911 to SSH ER: EKG TWI inferiorly\n\n- 09/26/07: Echo (SSH): LA 39, LVIDd 52, PWT 10, IVS 10, LVEF 40%, mild MR, AV leaflets thickened with thin mobile echo densities c/w Lamble&#8217;s excrescence, ascending aorta 34, WMA inferior/septal/anterior/apical territories, LVEF 40%, new WMA compared to 2/05\n\n- 09/29/07: Angio (SSH/Dr Ochoa): LM patent, LAD 40% prox at  D1, D1 50%, mLAD 85%, pOM2 30%, pOM3 30%, RCA (dominant) mRCA 70% at stent inlet, 95% mPDA, BMS PDA 2.25x12 mm, mLAD BMS 2.75x15 mm and 2.5x12 mm\n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n\nCAD (as above)\n\ns/p radical prostatectomy (10/07)\n\ns/p RML resection for carcinoid tumor (2096)\n\ns/p bleomycin rx (2085) and xrt (2084) for Hodgkins' disease\n\nDM2\n\nHTN\n\nGERD\n\ns/p appendectomy (2061)\n\ns/p knee surgery (2069)\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION\n\nAcetylsalicylic Acid (Aspirin )  325 MG PO QD\n\nAtorvastatin (Lipitor )  80 MG PO QD\n\nGlyburide  5 MG PO BID BEFORE BREAKFAST AND BEFORE SUPPER\n\nLisinopril  20 MG PO BID\n\nMetformin  1000 MG PO BID BEFORE BREAKFAST AND BEFORE SUPPER\n\nNadolol  40 MG PO QD\n\nOmeprazole  20 MG PO QD\n\nZolpidem Tartrate (Ambien)  5 MG PO QHS\n\n\n\nALLERGIES/ADVERSE REACTIONS \n\nPCN &#8211; rash; Shellfish\n\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nF &#8211; d, 87, MI (47), CABG x2\n\nM- d, 84 Parkinson&#8217;s disease, DM\n\nB &#8211; CABG x2, CHF (50s)\n\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nLives in Kemmerer.

Her problems are as follows:\n \n1.   Diabetes.  She was sent to me from OB/GYN because of her high glucose \n     and she was put on insulin by me.  Xitlali Xia followed her in \n     order to get her on a good dose but then she was lost to follow up as \n     she did not come to her appointments and did not return phone calls.  \n     She finally comes back and I am relieved, but she has not brought any \n     list of her blood sugars.  She says she does take them about twice a \n     day and she did write them down but her daughter ripped them up and \n     threw them away.  She says that they never go higher than 200; that \n     they usually are about 110.  It was 101 this morning before \n     breakfast, she says.  She says it does get as low as 19 and five or \n     six times it has been below 50.  She does say she eats three regular \n     meals but then later in the morning when I asked her if she had eaten \n     breakfast she said no.  She is seeing a nutritionist this morning.\n \n     I will check a hemoglobin A1C today.  I expressed to her again how \n     important it is that she eat three regular meals, but not sweets.  \n     She had been eating a lot of chocolate.  She says she has gotten off \n     of a lot of this although she does have cravings for it and eats it \n     then.  She is going to a nutritionist today and I hope that she will \n     help her with her diet.  If her diet does get better, maybe we can \n     wean her off the insulin and try Micronase.  I explained to her, too, \n     that if she both had a good diet and lost some weight that we might \n     be able to get her off the insulin.  This seemed to be something that \n     she would like to do.  Hopefully the nutritionist can help.  I also \n     told her that in order to find out what was going on that I need her \n     to take her blood sugar before breakfast, lunch, dinner and sleep, \n     and then come back in a week and a half so that we can see what was \n     really going on and whether they are getting too low.  She denies any \n     kind of symptoms with even as low a blood sugar as 19.  I am \n     wondering if she is remembering all these blood sugars correctly.  \n     She had no shakiness, no loss of consciousness, no dizziness, no \n     nothing.  She felt totally normal.  So hopefully she will really \n     record these and we will get a better idea.  She said this always \n     happens in the morning.  She kept contradicting herself and had no \n     documentation.  I went over with her the symptoms of hypoglycemia.  \n     Once she had a low blood sugar by fingerstick.  She does drink juice, \n     but I went over the symptoms again with her.  She will call me if she \n     does have any.\n                                              10-19-86\n \n \n \n2.   Left ankle pain.  I sent her to the orthopedist as she requested.  \n     She said that she may do some surgery on her.\n \n3.   Dysuria.  She says this is totally resolved after giving her the \n     Bactrim.\n \n4.   Yeast infection.  She said this has also resolved.\n \n5.   She complains of headache.  She says these have been going on for two \n     or three months; that light and noise bother her when she has some.  \n     She has had nausea and vomited once.  This happened pretty much every \n     day and it can be at any time of the day.  Tylenol and Advil did not \n     help.  She knows she is going to have a headache because it starts in \n     the back of her left ear very faintly and then it spreads from there.  \n     But she has no further prodrome.  She says it is a banging kind of \n     pain that is rhythmic.  She also says she does see stars in front of \n     her eyes when it happens.  I asked her if she had any hearing loss, \n     and she said that she hears voices but people are not there \n     sometimes.  It has been happening for a couple of weeks.  I discussed \n     this with Dr. Jacoby and we both agreed that these do sound like \n     migraines.  I will not image her head now as there is no evidence \n     that this would be something to do with brain tumor.  Her neuro exam \n     was totally normal.  Cranial nerves II-XII were checked and intact.  \n     Her gait was normal.  Light touch was touched.  Her toes were \n     downgoing.  Her reflexes were symmetric bilaterally.  Her disks were \n     sharp.  EOMI, PERRL.  I gave her a prescription for Motrin, 600 mg PO \n     t.i.d. and told her to take one the minute she got the pain behind \n     her left ear.  I will see her in a week and a half to reassess this.\n \n6.   Health maintenance.  I thought that since she is diabetic and obese \n     that she might benefit from a flu shot.  She has no interest in this \n     at all.  Her blood pressure was 110/70 in the left arm with a thigh \n     cuff.  Her pulse was 96.  Her blood sugar was 151 and her weight was \n     285.\n \n \n \n \n_________________________\nXitlali Crane, M.D.\n \nCCL:FG:1879\nDD:10-19-86\nDT:10-21-86\nDV:10-19-86\n ******** Approved but not reviewed by Attending Provider ********\n\n\n\n\n",

Diabetes.  She said she has been doing well, sticking to her diet, \n     has had no hypoglycemic episodes, and that her fingersticks have been \n     ranging between 120 and 160, never above and never below.  This is \n     borne out by her last hemoglobin A1C on 6-04-87 which was 4.9.  She \n     definitely does have good control, and she is working hard as her weight \n     is down to 236 lb from 238.75 on 6-29-87.  She had a recent hemoglobin A1C \n     and urine dip.  She, however, is due for an eye exam as she has no had one \n     for over a year and is willing to go, so I referred her.  She also needs \n     to see a Podiatrist as she has not seen one; she will go.\n \n2.   Health maintenance.  Patient does not want a flu shot.  Otherwise, \n     she is up to date except for a Pap smear, but she had her daughter \n     with her so asked if she could have her Pap smear on her next visit.  \n     We will do so.\n \n3.   Migraine headaches.  She said she has had one every day recently.  \n     This is worse than her usual.  The Motrin was not helping.  I \n     therefore prescribed Midrin and explained to her expressly how to \n     use.  Should this not help, she will page me as she knows how to do.  \n     I will see her back soon to make sure this is getting better.\n \n4.   Ankle pain.  Patient has chronic ankle pain.  She went to an \n     Orthopedist who told her a while back to lose weight and see if it \n     got better.  She has been slowly losing weight with no improvement \n     and would like to go back to the Orthopedist.  I therefore referred \n     her at her request.\n \n \n \n_________________________\nXitlali Crane, M.D. \n \nFS:XI:4842\nDD:10-19-87\nDT:10-20-87\nDV:10-19-87\n ******** Approved but not reviewed by Attending Provider ********\n\n\n\n\n",

Patient's diabetes was \ninitially diagnosed during gestation with her daughter.  Patient was \nformerly controlled by insulin but has lost 61 pounds over the last 16 \nmonths and is now off all medications and states her finger sticks have \nbeen excellent with a peak of about 150, with most well below that.  \nPatient also has a history of        in situ which was treated with laser \ntreatment to the cervix.  She is a hemophiliac carrier.  Has a history of \nmigraines and currently is being treated by Dr. Jacoby for depression.  \nSince her last visit with Dr. Crane, patient apparently attempted suicide \nin July.  It is unclear how serious the attempt was although she did cut \nher left upper extremity.  Since then she states that she has been feeling \na lot better and feels that she has really made progress with Dr. Jacoby.  \nHer mood seems fine today in clinic.  Patient denies any medical symptoms \nat this time.\n \nPatient's cardiac risk factors include smoking 5-6 cigarettes a day.  A \npositive family history of coronary artery disease including a mother who \njust died of a heart attack in May at age 53 and had had a previous MI at \nage 40 and a CABG at age 43.  Patient does not have hypercholesterolemia \nor hypertension but does have the diabetes history as noted above.\n \nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Notable for tobacco use as noted above and she drinks \nabout one beer per day when she is distraught that she continues to do.  \nShe says that she should not be drinking with her medications.\n \nPHYSICAL EXAM:  Moderately obese Hispanic woman in no acute distress.  \nBlood pressure: 120/70.  HEENT: unremarkable.  Neck: no JVD, carotids were \n2+ bilaterally without bruits.  Chest: clear.  Cardiac: within normal \nlimits.  Abdomen: benign.  Extremities: without edema.\n \nASSESSMENT/PLAN:\n1.   Weight control:  Patient has had excellent weight loss over the last \n     16 months.  I told her how impressed I was with this.  She, in fact, \n     does not require any oral hypoglycemics for good sugar control at \n     this time.  I will let her continue this dietary control for the next \n     six months and check her hemoglobin A1C at that time to assess her \n     control.  However, in the past, she has been very straight forward \n     with Dr. Crane according to her notes.\n2.   Depression:  Patient continues to be actively depressed.  Is \n     currently on trazodone, Klonopin, Paxil and Motrin.  She will \n     continue to follow-up with Dr. Jacoby with whom she seems to be very \n     happy.\nLOVELAND INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Youngman, Cody\nPage 2                                        06386371\n                                              9-14-88\n \n \n \n3.   General health care:  Patient will need a pelvic exam in six months \n     time.  Patient currently has an intrauterine device which was placed \n     in June.  She does not take oral contraceptives because of her \n     history of diabetes and history of heart disease.  She was instructed \n     that she should go to Gynecological Clinic if any symptoms related to \n     the IUD occur.\n4.   Diabetes:  Patient's blood sugars have had peaks of about 150 as \n     mentioned above.  I will check her hemoglobin A1C in six months time.  \n     Patient feels good with no polydipsia, no urinary frequency and no \n     headache.  I elected, therefore, not to treat it at this time.  \n     Patient was given prescriptions for fingersticks and lancets.\n \n \n \n_________________________\nRaymond Castaneda, M.D.\n \nNW:ZR:8898\nDD:9-14-88\nDT:9-15-88\nDV:9-14-88\n Attending Physician: YOCOM,GARY ZACHARY,M.D.\n\n\n\n\n",

Type II diabetes mellitus.\n2.   CAD.\n3.   History of CIN2 status post laser treatment to the cervix.\n4.   Depression.\n5.   History of substance abuse.\n6.   GERD.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Enteric-coated aspirin 325mg PO q.d., atenolol \n25mg PO q.d., glyburide 5mg PO q.d., Lipitor 10mg PO q.h.s., Celexa 20mg \nPO q.d., Zantac 150mg PO q.h.s., Prevacid 30mg PO q.d., trazodone 150mg \nPO q.h.s.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Youngman returns to clinic today to \nfollow up regarding her diabetes, coronary artery disease, and \ndepression.  Since I last saw her, she presented to Urgent Care \ncomplaining of some epigastric discomfort and was referred to \nGastroenterology where apparently she was started on Prevacid at 30mg a \nday in addition to maintenance with q.h.s. Zantac and scheduled for a \nupper GI series with a small bowel follow-through with a plan to add a \npro-motility agent if there was no structural abnormalities on her GI \nstudy.  She is scheduled later this month.  She has no new complaints, \nalthough she recently stopped taking her glyburide and has not refilled \nit over the past two days.  She denies any increasing polyuria, \npolydipsia, polyphagia.  Says until yesterday, she had been taking all \nof her medications regularly, although mostly at night rather than in \nthe morning.  I pressed her about this because she has a history of \nbeing noncompliant with her medicines in the past, but she does maintain \nthat she has been taking them.  It is not entirely clear to me whether \nthis is true or not.  \n\nRegarding her depression, she denies any suicidal ideation.  She says \nshe is feeling a little bit better.  She was recently started on \nrisperidone in addition to her Celexa, apparently by a psychiatrist at \nthe Connerstone Regional Hospital by the name of Dr. Lehman whom she sees once \na month.  She is also seeing a counselor there weekly.  She says overall \nshe is doing a little bit better, although still intermittently binge \ndrinking and occasionally smoking marijuana.  We again discussed the \nimportance of AA; she says she is not interested in that.  \n\nRegarding her coronary disease, she continues to have exertional angina \nafter approximately 14 steps which has not increased in intensity or \nfrequency.  She denies any PND or orthopnea, denies any chest pain at \nrest.  \n\n\nLOVELAND MEMEORIAL HOSPITAL\nLOVELAND Internal Medicine Associates\n57  Colgate Road                             Youngman, Cody\nCincinnati, WA  33699                             06386371\n                                              11-30-93 \nPage 2\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:  She is a morbidly obese woman in no acute distress.  Her \npulse is 80 and regular, blood pressure 134/74.  Her weight today is \n249lb.  Her sclera are nonicteric.  Her JVP is not visible at 90 \ndegrees.  There are no carotid bruits.  Her lungs are clear to \nauscultation bilaterally, and her cardiac exam reveals a regular rhythm, \npositive S1, S2.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.  Her \nextremities are warm and without significant edema.  Her finger stick \nblood sugar in the office today was 331.\n\nASSESSMENT/PLAN:  Thirty six year old woman with multiple medical \nproblems, including a history of noncompliance and substance abuse.\n\n1.   Diabetes.  Her last hemoglobin A1C was approximately 9.3, \n     essentially unchanged from six months prior.  Finger stick in the \n     office is 331 today, confirming her recent noncompliance and would \n     now describe that she has not been taking her medicine regularly \n     over the past couple of months.  In any event, she most likely need \n     a higher dose of sulphonurea.  We will check a hemoglobin A1C \n     today, and if it remains in the 9 range or higher, will increase \n     her glyburide to 10mg daily, and I talked to her about the plan.  \n     Her last urine microalbumin was negative.\n\n2.   Hypercholesterolemia.  When she returns to clinic in three months, \n     we will recheck a lipid profile by which time she will have been on \n     Lipitor for approximately six months.\n\n3.   Coronary disease.  She is still having exertional chest pain.  \n     Increased her atenolol to 50mg PO q.d. as she did have room to go \n     with her pulse and blood pressure.\n\n4.   Depression.  I again encouraged her to continue following up with \n     her psychiatrist and her counselor.  Again, reinforced the \n     importance of trying to remain substance free and recommended AA \n     again as I have in the past.\n\n5.   GERD.  She will follow up with Gastroenterology and continue on her \n     PPI and H2 blocker for now.  I told her she should take the \n     Prevacid in the morning and the Zantac at night only.\n\n6.   Health maintenance.  She received a flu shot and she will return to \n     clinic in three months to follow up on her diabetes, \n     hypercholesterolemia, and coronary disease.  Additionally, I \n     referred her to Nutrition for further counseling regarding weight \n     loss and a heart-healthy diabetic diet.  I also stressed the \n     \nLOVELAND MEMEORIAL HOSPITAL\nLOVELAND Internal Medicine Associates\n06  Colgate Road                             Youngman, Cody\nCincinnati, WA  33699                             06386371\n                                              11-30-93 \nPage 3\n\n\n     importance of her seeing the eye doctor.  She says she is scheduled \n     to see the eye doctor this month given that she is at risk for \n     diabetic retinopathy.\n\n\n\n_________________________\nJeffrey Koehler, M.D.\n\nLX:ZK:3809; DD:11-30-93; DT:12-3-93; DV:11-30-93 \n\n\n========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================\n\nCase discussed with Dr Koehler.  DM: glucose in the 300s.  Ran out of meds.  Compliance a problem.  We are restarting glyburide today.  MIBI was positive, but we are trying medical management.  Increasing atenolol to 50mg.  Cont.

Since I last saw her, she \n\nhas been hospitalized with bilateral pyelonephritis in mid \n\nOctober.  Since discharge, she has been feeling well, and a \n\nrepeat urinalysis and urine culture on October 27, 2094, were \n\nessentially within normal limits.  She denies any recurrent flank \n\npain, fevers, chills, or dysuria.  Says overall she is feeling \n\nrelatively well.  She is taking all of her medications as \n\nprescribed.  She denies any polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, \n\nfatigue, or blurry vision.  She continues to smoke.  She has not \n\nbeen exercising.  She also continues to have intermittent chest \n\npain of unclear etiology.  Several days ago, she had an episode \n\nthat lasted a minute or two at rest.  She described it as a \n\ntightness, and it was not associated with shortness of breath, \n\nnausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or neck or arm symptoms.  She has \n\nno recurrent symptoms since then, and has had no exertional \n\nsymptoms in the past few days.  She has not been taking her blood \n\nsugars at home as her machine is broken.  Also, she self-\n\ndiscontinued her lisinopril.  She thought it gave her a headache.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoungman, Codi \n\n06386371\n\n11/24/94\n\nPage 2\n\n\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is an obese young woman in no \n\ndistress.  Pulse 68 and regular.  Blood pressure 134/84 and \n\nweight 226.  Fingerstick today 198.  Neck veins are non-elevated.  \n\nNo carotid bruits.  Oropharynx is clear.  Lungs are clear to \n\nauscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac exam is regular rhythm.  \n\nNormal S1 and S2.  No murmurs.  Extremities are warm and without \n\nedema.  Feet are without ulcerations and sensation is intact to \n\nvibration and light touch.\n\n\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Her EKG today reveals a normal sinus rhythm, \n\nnormal axis, normal intervals, normal ST segments, and normal T-\n\nwaves.  Hematocrit and troponin are pending.\n\n\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 37-year-old woman with multiple medical \n\nproblems as follows:\n\n1.\tType 2 diabetes.  Her hemoglobin A1c has continued to run in \n\nthe 9.0.  She is poorly controlled and remains unwilling to \n\ntry Glucophage again due to the diarrhea.  At this point, it \n\nis prudent to consider switching her over to an insulin \n\nregimen starting with b.i.d. NPH, and we will refer her to the \n\ndiabetic teaching nurse, and see her back in about a month \n\nwith a plan to transition her at that time.  Her urine \n\nmicroalbumin was negative a few months ago.  We will recheck \n\nher hemoglobin A1c today.  She has been to the ophthalmologist \n\nrecently, and does not need to see the podiatrist as of yet.\n\n2.\tRegarding her chest pain, her persistent intermittent chest \n\npain is somewhat concerning.  She does have coronary disease \n\nas per her MIBI just over a year ago.  She is taking an \n\naspirin and a beta-blocker.  Her EKG today is normal, and she \n\nhas been symptom free for at least the past 2-3 days even with \n\nexertion.  Given this, I advised her should she have recurrent \n\npain at rest or with minimal exertion to call me and come to \n\nthe emergency room, otherwise, to continue taking her aspirin \n\nand beta-blocker.  I will repeat her stress test to see if her \n\nischemic burden has increased in which case we will consider \n\nreferring her to Cardiology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\tYoungman, Codi \n\n\t06386371\n\n\t11/24/94\n\n\tPage 3\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n3.\tRegarding her hypertension, given her diabetes, we would \n\nprefer better blood pressure control.  She agreed to try the \n\nlisinopril again at a small dose, and will let me know if she \n\nthinks it disagrees with her.  I told her I felt the headache \n\nwas probably unrelated to the lisinopril.\n\n4.\tRegarding health maintenance, when I see her back in a month, \n\nI will do a Pap smear and give her a flu shot, as she left \n\ntoday without receiving one.  \n\n5.\tI will see her back in clinic in one month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\n\nJeffrey Koehler, M.D.\n\n\n\nJK/JW4\n\n502491.do\n\nc\n\nDD:  \n\n11/24/2094\n\nDT:  \n\n11/25/2094\n\nDV:  \n\n11/24/2094\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================\n\n\n\n===========================Preceptor Notes====================================\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Koehler and I jointly interviewed and examined this  37  year old patient who presents for f/u of diabetes, depression, pyelonephritis. See resident's note for details. PMH/FH/SH significant for GERD , substance abuse. ROS remarkable for headache. \n\n\n\nOn exam, we found pulse 68, neck  veins flat, chest clear. See Resident's note for further detail. Of note is .\n\nnormal podiatry exam.\n\nImpression and Plan reviewed and I agree with the resident's assessment of  mult med problems and diagnosis of diabetes,depression  . We agree on the plan to  switch to bid NPH, restart lisinopril, f/u appt with diabetic teaching nurse. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________                              \n\n\n\nRahasia Pauline Vuong, M.D.\n\n\n\n",

He received a cardiac workup for the chest pain including baseline EKG, exercise tolerance test, and Myoview study.  Baseline EKG was unremarkable with normal sinus rhythm but the ETT was positive with inverted T waves, ST segment downsloping depressions in the anterolateral and inferior leads, and PVC   s in recovery.  The patient had no chest pain and good exercise capacity during the ETT, which was terminated after 9 minutes because of leg fatigue.  On the Myoview study, a small area of ischemia with possibly minimal scaring was noted in the inferior wall although wall motion was normal.  Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 62%.  A subsequent exercise echo was normal.  Baseline blood pressures at the time of the workup measured 160/68 with systolic pressures noted as high as 180.  His blood pressure has been since controlled on atenolol and was measured per patient account to be around 148/80 at his most recent visit to his PCP in August.  Hemoglobin A1C in 2147 was 6.2 and diabetes has been managed with only diet.   He was previously using daily aspirin but stopped in October 2148 for a dermatologic surgery and did not restart.  \n\nMr. Eubanks was in his usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission when he developed two episodes of low grade chest pain, once in the morning and once in the evening.  These episodes lasted only 1-2 minutes, and seemed to him to be related to his ongoing issues with gout.  The chest pain was not associated with shortness of breath and seemed to improve with indomethacin, which he typically takes for acute exacerbations of gout.  His course over the next two days was unremarkable and he went to bed comfortable the night prior to admission.  He was awakened near 3 am by 8/10 burning chest pain and pressure in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of his back but not to the neck or jaw.  Associated with the chest pain were chills and a feeling of increased heart rate although the patient denies shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or vomiting, headache, lightheadedness, fever, or vision changes.  The pain persisted for 2 hours without improvement or alleviating factors, prompting the patient to have his wife drive him to BBH ED from his Cheney home.  \n\nReview of systems was positive for polyuria, increased thirst, mild non-productive cough, post-nasal drip, and intermittent mild diarrhea in past months.  The patient denies recent or past history of edema, GERD, claudication, clots, hemoptysis, hematemesis, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, wheezing, fatigue, appetite or weight changes, or night sweats.  \n\nIn the emergency department, the patient was given aspirin, lopressor, sublingual nitroglycerin, and 2L O2 by nasal cannula, and chest pain subsequently resolved.  EKG on presentation showed a poor baseline in sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy.  Subsequent EKG   s revealed continued PVC   s and PAC   s with biphasic T-waves in V4-5.  A chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia or acute CHF and showed no evidence of widened mediastinum.  CT scans with and without contrast which were negative for aortic dissection.  Cardiac enzymes x 2 sets were negative, but D-dimer was elevated at 816.  Stool sample was guiac positive, although CBC was stable with HCT 44.6.  \n\n\n\n\nPMH:  \n\nHypertension, treated with atenolol\nDiabetes mellitus type II, managed with diet\nGout, treated with colchicine and indomethacin\nBasal cell carcinoma on right ear, s/p excision in Oct 2148\nRecurrent sinusitis\n\nPSH:\nBasal cell carcinoma excision, Oct 2148\nNasal septum repair\n\nMeds (on admission):\nAtenolol (dose unknown)\nColchicine 5 mg qday\nIndomethacin 50 mg prn gout exacerbation\n\nAllergies:  \nAllopurinol    hives\nHay fever\n\nFH:  \nPatient has relatively poor recollection of his family history.  \nMother:  died at 89 yo, h/o heart disease requiring pacemaker, osteoporosis\nFather:  died young of brain tumor\nBrother:  died of cardiac arrest March 2147; h/o catheterization with stent\nSister:  probable heart disease\nGrandparents:  grandmother lived into 80s\n\nSH:\nNon smoker\nOccupational exposures (i.e. mold) through work as an economic policy analyst\nSocial drinker, very mild\nDenies IV or other drug use\nDenies sick contacts, remarkable travel history\nLives at home with wife; has two children 18, 25\nHappy, does not have problems with mood\n\nROS:  As above in HPI.

No evidence of aortic dissection.  5 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, for which three month follow up chest CT is recommended to exclude malignancy.  Choelithiasis without cholecystitis.  Punctate calcification in the left kidney, without evidence for hydroureteralnephrosis, likely vascular, though renal calculus is possible.\n\nAssessment:\n\nMr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with HTN, DM II, and gout, who presents with 2 hours of severe chest pain.  The differential for chest pain is broad and includes cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus, bronchitis, pleurisy, GERD/esophageal spasm, musculoskeletal/chest wall pain, and anxiety.  The sudden onset of severe chest pain, awaking him from sleep, raises the probability of an acute cardiac or pulmonary event such as MI, aortic dissection, or PE.  The patient has elevated D-Dimer but otherwise lacks physical exam findings (dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, signs of DVT) or CT/CTA imaging features consistent with pulmonary embolism.  The patient   s HTN is a risk factor for aortic dissection, but this diagnosis can be ruled out by negative CXR and CTA scans, which have 80     95% sensitivity.  In addition, he lacks a number of other clinical manifestations of dissection, including syncope, pulse deficits, and new murmur.  The distribution of the pain is anginal in distribution and is relieved by nitroglycerin + aspirin.  Moreover, the patient has had two similar but less severe attacks a few days ago, and has multiple cardiac risk factors.  This makes unstable angina or myocardial infarction the most likely diagnosis.  \nEKG changes lacked ST segment elevation, although T-wave inversions were present in some leads.   The patient   s cardiac enzymes were negative from the ED x 2 sets with a third troponin negative on the floor.  The patient may have either a non-ST elevation MI or unstable angina.  The plan will be to continue monitoring closely for chest pain and EKG changes, with the next step likely to involve stress test or catheterization in the morning tomorrow.  Cardiology is following closely and has provided recommendations that are incorporated into the plan.  \n\n\nPlan:  \n\n1.  Chest pain\nTelemetry, cardiac monitor\nTroponin, CK, CK-MB q8h x 3\nLDH on next draw\nEKG if chest pain reemerges or in AM if no chest pain flare\nASA 325 mg po qd\nMetoprolol 37.5 mg PO q8h\nNitroglycerin 0.3 mg 1 tablet prn chest pain\nIf chest pain continues, enzymes positive, EKG changes    add IV heparin\nIf chest pain flare, enzymes positive, or EKG changes, consider catheterization.  Otherwise exercise-MIBI in AM.  \nNPO except MEDS after midnight; diabetic diet before midnight\nHold AM B-Blocker dose for exercise MIBI\nCheck in AM for fasting lipids, A1C \n\n2.  Ventricular Ectopy\nReplete K, Mg to meet goals (K = 4.0, Mg = 2.0)\n\n3.  GI bleed\nGuiac positive stools\nHCT stable \nAM labs:  CBC (HCT),Diff,Lytes,Glucose,BUN/Creatinine,Calcium,Phosphorus,Magnesium\n\n4.  Diabetes\nStable, controlled by diet at home\nBlood glucose fingersticks AC + HS\nHgA1C in AM\nUrinalysis in AM (proteinuria per prior notes)\n\n5. Prophylaxis \nSennosides\nDocusate sodium \n\n6.  Code Status:  Full Code\n\n\n\n\nThe assessment and plan were discussed with the senior teaching resident.\n\n\n\nRobert Rich\nMS III \nPager:  #81852\n\nIntern Addendum: I have interviewed and examined the pt with the medical student. In brief, the pt is a 67M w HTN gout and DM who woke up at 3am today with chest pressure and pain that radiated to both arms. He did feel slightly SOB but there was no N, V, diaphoresis or lightheadedness at this time. The episode lasted less than one minute and he felt better after he took indomethacin. Upon further questioning, he thinks he had two similar episodes last week. He has not had any DOE, PND, or LE edema. He does recall having chest pressure and chest pain in Feb 2147 when he had a    cardiac evaluation    at the Pennsylvania Hospital. He does not know the details of the workup. Of note the pt does not smoke, is not on ASA, and has several family members with CAD but no men <55 or women<65. He is on atenolol     but unsure of the dose. \nIn the ED, he did have some chest pain but it was relieved after 1 nitro. HR was 85 and BP 135/82. He was given ASA and a BB. Initially, his EKG was read as normal but later the T waves became biphasic in leads V4-6. Repeat EKGs when he was chest pain free, showed flipped Ts in V4-6. There were no old EKGs available for comparison. He was seen by cardiology who recommended holding off on heparin bolus as he was found to be guaiac + (Hct 44). A dissection protocol CT was performed and was neg for dissection and for a central PE. (the ddimer was elevated). His first two sets of cardiac enzymes were negative and he was sent to the floor for further evaluation. On exam, he was in NAD and was CP free. Heart was RRR, lungs CTAB and he had no lower extremity edema. ASA and BB were cont. The third set of cardiac enzymes came back negative and the pt was scheduled for a stress test. However, the patient did experience some chest discomfort this morning and therefore cardiology felt it was best to take him to cath instead. This is planned for this morning. Please note this pt is allergic to Allopurinol. \n\nV. A. Nunes MD 32043\nInternal Medicine Intern\n\n\n\n",

On the morning of admission, patient developed more severe chest pain and pressure radiating to both arms and back.  Pain persisted for 2 hours, prompting the patient to present to the BBH ED for further care. In the ED, patient was treated with ASA, metoprolol, sl NTG, and chest pain resolved. EKGs showed biphasic T-waves in V4-5.  CT scan was negative for aortic dissection or other acute pathology.  Cardiac markers were negative.  Patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine service for further management. Of note, at Pennsylvania Hospital, patient had a positive ETTMIBI showing fixed + mild reversible defect in the inferoapical region in 2/47, followed up with normal exercise echo in 5/47.\n\n\n\nOn first night of admission, patient developed recurrent chest pain when going to the bathroom.  Because of his risk factors for disease, the decision was made to proceed directly to cardiac catheterization. In the cath lab, patient was found to have multivessel CAD with an LAD culprit.  He received 3xCypher stents to the mid and distal LAD with residual flow limitation.  RCA with moderate disease.  LCx with distal disease.  \n\nPatient was transferred to the SDU for further care.He was started on beta-blockers and ace-inhibition, and tolerated these medications well.  He was evaluated for cardiac rehab. Of note, patient was informed of the pulmonary nodule located on CT scan and the need for follow-up CT in 3 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n\n   CAD as above\n\nHTN\n\nHyperlipidemia\n\nGout\n\nDM type 2\n\nGERD\n\nPulmonary nodule\n\n\n\n\tMedications (Confirmed):\n\n\t\n\nASA  325 mg po qd\n\natenolol \n\nIndocin  50 mg po bid PRN gout flares\n\nLipitor  80mg po qd\n\nlisinopril \n\nomeprazole \n\nPlavix \n\n\n\nAllergies:\n\n\t\n\nDrug allergy   Allopurinol led to hives.\n\n\n\n\tFamily history:\n\n   Mother died at 89, had heart disease.

He will then stop, pain will disappear.  He will continue\n\nwalking at which time it will occur at about the same distance.  There is no rest\n\npain.  The pain had been present for a couple of months although it has been\n\nincreasing in severity.   \n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Is significant for intracranial bleed secondary to an\n\nAV malformation.  He refused surgery at that time at Campellton-Graceville Hospital and has done\n\nwell on Dilantin without any seizures.  There has been no further bleed or problem\n\nfrom this malformation.  He also has treated hypothyroidism.  He is status post\n\nTURP, cholecystectomy, and appendectomy.  He does have a chronic anxiety\n\ndisorder for which he is on Ativan intermittently.  He also has pustular psoriasis.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Dilantin 600 mg per day, which keeps his level at about 7.  At\n\nthese levels he has had no seizures.  He is also on Synthroid at 0.075 per day.  \n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a mostly German-speaking man.  There is a\n\nright-sided tremor which has been present since his intracranial bleed.  Neck\n\nsupple.  Blood pressure is at 140/80.  Weight 184.  Heart rate is at 70.  There are\n\nno carotid bruits.  Lungs are clear.  Heart is regular without gallop or murmur. \n\nAbdominal exam - No mass, tenderness, or organomegaly.  There are multiple\n\nscars. There is a bruit over the right femoral artery with a decreased pulsation there\n\ncompared to the left.  There is no pulse palpable below popliteal on the right side. \n\nThere is no visible ischemic change of the right leg.  The left femoral is fuller, and\n\nthere is a palpable dorsalis pedis on that side.  \n\n\n\nIMPRESSION:  Peripheral vascular disease, probably right iliofemoral.  He will\n\nundergo arteriovascular studies.  He will also be placed on aspirin at 81 mg per\n\nday.  In addition he is begun on Lipitor 10 mg per day for hyperlipidemia.  He will\n\nfollow up following that vascular study.  This evaluation was also communicated to\n\nher daughter, Quinn, because of the language barrier.\n\n\n\n\n\nXenia Jaramillo, M.D.\n\n\n\nXJ/camp/williams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

No dysuria.\n\nHis daughter reports that he is eating well, that he is at his baseline mental status,\n\nthat he has had not had any acute complaints at home. \n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As per HPI. Also, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder\n\ndue to a congenital AVM, osteoporosis, peripheral vascular disease.\n\n\n\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\n\n\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 q.d., atenolol 25 b.i.d., Zocor 20 q.h.s.,\n\nCarafate 1 gm p.o. b.i.d., Celexa 10 q.d., multivitamins, thiamine 100 q.d., Seroquel\n\n37.5 q.h.s. and 12.5 q.a.m., Flomax 0.8 q.d., Synthroid 100 q.d., Dilantin 150 p.o. t.i.d.,\n\nColace 100 t.i.d. \n\n\n\nVITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 112/52. Pulse 72. Weight 162. \n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: General - Elderly male in no acute distress. Appears well in\n\nconsideration of his recent long hospitalization. Neck - No JVD or bruits noted\n\nbilaterally. Lungs - Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes or rales. CV -\n\nRRR. Normal S1, S2. No murmurs. Abdomen - Positive bowel sounds heard in all 4\n\nquadrants, although mildly decreased. Soft, mildly distended. No masses. No HSM.\n\nNo fluid wave. Extremities - He has 1+ firm pitting edema to his mid-shin. \n\n\n\nLABS: From June 13, 2091, show CBC with white count of 4.4, hemoglobin 11.2,\n\nhematocrit 32.2. Chem 7 - BUN 26, creatinine 0.7, glucose 203, Dilantin 5.6. \n\n\n\nASSESSMENT & PLAN: 76-year-old male, history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia,\n\ncoronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, status post CABG in April as\n\nwell as AAA repair returns after an extended hospitalization with complications of\n\npneumonia, SBO, and PE who comes in for follow-up visit. Despite everything,\n\npatient looks well. \n\n\n\n(1)  CV. Will continue cardiac medications at this time. Will likely change Zocor\n\n     back to Lipitor but will check his labs first. Patient would benefit from cardiac\n\n     rehab at this time. He is scheduled to see Dr. Nutter at the end of this\n\n     month. Will arrange for him to have regular cardiac care after this. He has\n\n     seen Dr. Quesnel for his postop CABG issues.\n\n\n\n(2)  PVD. Patient status post AAA repair. He has seen Dr. Uddin and is doing\n\n     well. \n\n\n\n(3)  Neuro. Patient on Dilantin 150 t.i.d. as per Dr. Acuna. It would be okay to\n\n     decrease him to 100 t.i.d. as he was before. Will check  his levels today but\n\n     likely decrease to 100 t.i.d. Will refer back to Dr. Acuna for follow-up. \n\n\n\n(4)  Endocrine. Will check TSH. Likely will continue current Levoxyl dose.\n\n\n\n(5)  Osteoporosis. Okay to restart Fosamax.\n\n\n\n(6)  GI. Patient with constipation. He can start Citrucel or Metamucil twice a day.\n\n     Can also use Dulcolax daily until he has a bowel movement and then decrease\n\n     to every other day as needed. Can also adjust fiber therapy as needed.\n\n     Instructed patient and daughter that if patient is passing gas, it is okay.\n\n     However, if he stops, they should call immediately. \n\n\n\n(7)  Psych. They should continue Celexa and Seroquel for now. Will review charts\n\n     from Grant Clinic to see why medications were started and will likely\n\n     taper him off them.\n\n\n\nIn general, need to review records from Grant Clinic in order to see what\n\nhappened there. Will consider that in my recommendations for his further care.\n\nReturn to clinic in 2 weeks. \n\n\n\n\n\nDebra A. Rosenberg, M.D.\n\n\n\nDAR/camp/quevedo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The patient first presented to Waverly on 10/22 with complains of weakness, fatigue, decreased appetite and bilateral shoulder pain for a few weeks. He denied dyspnea, chest pain or pressure, productive cough, sore throat or runny nose. He was noted to have a fever of 101.2 at Waverly but denied other subjective fevers. His daughter had recently been hospitalized with pneumonia but he has no other sick contacts. At Waverly labs were drawn, a chest xray was done and he was given motrin and Tylenol and sent home. He returned for follow up the next day feeling no better. His labs reviewed a leukocytosis and acute kidney injury and his chest xray showed a RLL pneumonia. He was sent to the CGH for further evaluation.\n\n\n\nOn presentation to the ED at 1pm on 10/23, his VS were 98.2, 87, 122/60, 97% on 2LNC. He got 500cc of NS, Levaquin 750mg PO x 2, Ceftriaxone 1gm IV x 2 doses, his home doses of dilantin, finasteride and plavix and sent to the floor. \n\n\n\nUpon arrival to the floor he was in no distress. In addition to the above, he denied recent vomiting, diarrhea or feelings of numbness or dizziness. He has had less appetite recently. He denied injury or trauma to his shoulder which he said had been bothering him more and more for the past 3 weeks. \n\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per HPI. Other systems reviewed were negative in detail. \n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY\n\nstatus post TURP : \n\nHypothyroidism \n\nSeizure disorder related to AVM. \n\nNoncongenital left temporal AVM\n\nHyperlipidemia \n\nPeripheral vascular disease \n\nOsteoporosis \n\nAAA s/p repair in 3/91; \n\nCAD s/p 4 vessel CABG : 4/91 \n\nPE during hospitalization in 3/91\n\nAnemia (iron deficient) : FOBT positive, \n\nDiabetes : type 2- diet controlled\n\nMGUS, stable : per Dr Rhodes 5/97 &#8211; \n\nSecond degree heart block \n\n\n\nRECENT DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES\n\nRH Cath (3/97) DIAGNOSTIC CONCLUSIONS/OVERALL SUMMARY:\n\n\n1. Right heart catheterization - normal filling pressures. Hemodynamics: RAP \n\n\n1, RV 25/2, PAP 25/6, PCWP 6, CO 5.73\n\n\n2. RV biopsy was performed using a shor sheath through right internal jugular \n\n\nvein approach.\n\n\n3. A total of 4 biopsy obtained, fixed in formalin and sent to pathology. \n\n\nClosing RAP 2.\n\nNuclear Stress 12/96 CONCLUSION\n\n       The ECG is negative for ischemia.  The sensitivity of\n\n       adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting CAD is limited.\n\n       LV contractile function is normal.\n\n       The perfusion iamges show a large area of mild ischemia involving\n\n       the anteroseptal and inferior walls\n\n\n\nTTE: 11/96.

Vidal, M.D.\n\n\nJune 19, 2064\n\nFrank Ito, M.D.\nJewish Hospital\n61 Church Street\nMurfreesboro, UT  97331\n\nRE:  Rivers, Ida \nMRN: 71701456 \nDOV: 06/19/64\n\nDear Dr. Ito,\n\nIda was seen back today for evaluation of Sjogren's as well as left wrist \npain.  Her Sjogren's has been reasonably stable.  She still remains with \ndifficulty in controlling her blood sugar.  She has continued difficulty with \nher oral cavity.  She has had no extraglandular symptoms -- specifically, \npolyneuropathy, myopathy, or purpura.\n\nShe uses artificial tears and saliva.  She remains on insulin and estrogens.\n\nShe has a one-week history of pain and swelling of her left wrist.  She was \nseen at the Graduate Hospital Emergency Room several days ago.  Radiographs of the \nwrist show chondrocalcinosis.  She was started on Motrin with some response \nbut still has active symptoms.  She is wearing a splint.\n\nToday on exam, she is afebrile.  There was OA involving the DIP joints.  PIPs \nand MCPs were nontender.  The left wrist showed swelling and heat with \ndiminished motion.  Right wrist showed full range of motion.  Elbows, \nshoulders, hips, knees, ankles, and feet did not show active synovitis.  \nThere was no adenopathy and lungs were clear.\n\nI aspirated the left wrist under sterile technique.  No fluid was obtained.  \nI injected it with 40 mg of Depo-Medrol.\n\nClinically, I think she has had pseudogout.  She has chondrocalcinosis on \nradiograph and has a clinical picture consistent with crystal disease.  In \naddition, she has primary Sjogren's.  The two diseases are unrelated.\n\nIn addition to injection of her wrist, I switched her from Motrin to Celebrex \n200 mg twice a day due to side effect profile issues.  She should probably \ntake that for about five to seven days.  Side effects were reviewed.\n\nI would like to see her back in four months.  She will be returning to you \nfor further care in the interim.\n\n\n\nFrank Ito, M.D.\nRE:  Rivers, Ida \nMRN: 71701456 \nPage 2\n\n\nADDENDUM:  At her next visit, I will want her to check her calcium and \nthyroid status since that can be associated with CPPD disease.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\n\n \n_______________________________ \nRichard F. Vidal, M.D. \n \nDD: 06/19/64 \nDT: 06/22/64 \nDV: 06/19/64\n/turpin\n\n\n \n\n\n\n",

She noted that she was not feeling well throughout the morning, and she felt as if she may need to eat something.  However, because she did not have her insulin and blood sugar monitoring equipment, she decided not to eat.  She continued to feel poorly (she is somewhat vague on symptoms but reports feeling that her chest was congested and that she may have had some palpitations and felt chilled).  She saw a police cruiser, and walked over to it with the intention of getting help.  When she arrived, there was no one in the car, and she leaned forward to rest her head on the front of the car.  This is the last thing she remembered; when she awoke, she was surrounded by people.  She was told that she had falled backwards and hit the back of her head.  When EMS found her, she was confused, making repetitive statements, and stating that she had pain in her occiput that radiated down her neck.  When she arrived at the FMH ED, her blood pressure was 213/97 HR 84 RR20 O2 sat 99% RA Temp 97.3.  She received Labetolol 20 iv, Toradol 30 mg iv, ASA 325 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg po x 1.  Her mental status cleared somewhat, and her blood pressure came down to 130s/80s.  She did have one episode of emesis, during which her HR was noted to transiently dip to the 40s (not captured on the monitor); spontaneously recovered to the 60s.\n\nShe had a C-spine series and head CT which were negative for acute process, and a CXR which was negative except for R shoulder not well-visualized on CXR.  She was noted to have some superficial bleeding of her posterior scalp, but no obvious laceration.  She was admitted to the SDU because of the episode of bradycardia.\n\n\n\nPMH/PSH \n\n-Diabetes Type I (by her report) followed at Hometown Medical\n\n-Sjogren's disease, followed by Dr Vidal at RGH\n\n-Pseudogout\n\n-s/p benign breast mass resection 11 yrs ago.\n\n-?

In the ER, the pain was characterized as mechanical, but was also relieved by SLNTG (which however precipitated hypotension, brady to 30s). EKG showed only ? slight exaggeration of baseline 1mm ST elevation in V2, V3.  She was heparinized and admitted to SDU.  R/O by serial markers.  Cardiac cath on the day after admission showed a tight RCA (with unclear relationship to anterior ischemia seen on prior stress). She is now s/p Cypher stent, with plans for at least three months of Plavix.\n\n\n\nOther issues:\n\n- HgbA1c drawn during office visit was 11.3.\n\n- UTI, pan-sensitive E. coli\n\n\n\nMedications added at discharge included levofloxacin x 3 d, Plavix and MVI.

Has dilated eye exam scheduled for 2/67 \n\n- last Hgb A1C 9/66 still elevated 9.70 - last urine microalbumin screen 10/66 negative \n\nA: - 1/21/67: Pt reports that her AM sugars have been running high.  Her Lantus has been increased by the HMC staff from 9 U to 12 U to 14 U (as of several days ago) \n\n- 1/23/67 HgbA1c 11.3\n\nP: -1/21/67: q3 month HgbA1c while not meeting treatment goals; remains on Lantus 14 U qHS\n\n- 1/23/67: Pt has f/u appointment at HMC on 1/27.  Will also offer referral to FMH diabetes center for consolidated f/u.\n\nHypertension\n\nA:\n\n- 7/11/66: Hypertensive on atenolol 25 qd and lisinopril 20 qd when seen by Dr. Olszewski. He recommended the Omron HEM 711 model for home bp monitoring. Has kept a log of blood pressures, and based on the data, her lisinopril was increased to 40 mg qd and HCTZ 12.5 mg qd was added by Dr. Olszewski. - 8/21/66: Most recent measurements showed typical bp's 130-150/70s, HR 60s-70s. 160/90 in office. Didn't want to increase HCTZ until d/w cardiologist - 9/05: electrolytes wnl on HCTZ; HCTZ increased by Dr. Olszewski - 10/17/66: HCTZ d/c'd, amlodipine started at 5 mg given exacerbation of hypercalcemia - 12/12/67: Remained hypertensive.  D/w Dr. Olszewski and increased amlodipine to 10 mg QD - 1/21/67: BP 130/80 with HR 60 today.  Per Dr. Olszewski clinic note from 1/07/67, SBPs at home 129-135 with HR 60s \n\n- 1/23/67: No significant RAS seen on abdominal aortogram\n\nP: -1/21/67: c/w current regimen: lisinopril 40, norvasc 10, atenolol 25\n\n- 1/24/67: Pt was instructed to schedule post discharge bp check in office\n\nCoronary artery disease\n\nA:\n\n- Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, HTN, remote tobacco, postmenopausal - Adenosine-MIBI 6/08/2066:    ECG response to pharmacological stress was  positive for ischemia. The perfusion images are suggestive of a small area of mild anterior ischemia. - TTE 6/2066: dilated LA, mild to moderate MR, borderline symmetric LVH, no SWMA, EF 71%, moderate TR, RVSP 42 mmHg    -1/21/67: No chest pain or SOB \n\n- Admitted with left shoulder pain 1/22/67. R/o by markers.  Cath 1/23 showed calcified subtotally occluded RCA which was PCI'd with a CYPHER stent (the vessel was on the smaller side and was co-dominant) as well as OM2 and OM3 disease not intervened on because small territory.  \n\nP: \n\n- 1/23/67:  Plavix x 3 months added to current regimen of ASA, lipitor, atenolol, lisinopril, amlodipine.  Patient also enrolled in HIT Cath study and will need repeat HIT antibody and platelet draw on d3 and d7 post cath.\n\n\n\nOther Problems\n\nSyncope\n\nA; Reports occasional fainting spells since youth.  Had an extensive w/u at SVRHC per patient.  ? diabetic nephropathy versus vasovagal faints.  Has not had recurrence since her last clinic visit in July. - 1/05/67:  Seen by neuro; etiology remains unclear. No significant vascular lesion on 6/66 CTA.  Old CVA suspected based on exam, including diffuse hyperreflexia and facial asymmetry. Lp(a) and homocysteine wnl. - 1/21/67: No further syncope/presyncope, but still concerned about having sustained head injury \n\nP: Dischaged from FMH with plans for a loop recorder - received a letter from Dr.K. Ivan Olszewski of the Cardiac Unit who saw Ms. Rivers on 7/11/66.  He reports that results of her event monitor revealed no arrhythmias.  He concurs that her episodes sound like they may be related to vagal episodes. \n\n- 1/05/67:  f/u brain MRI and EEG scheduled by neuro \n\n- 1/24/67:  Called patient and reviewed that she will need to reschedule her MRI given her new stent (~8 weeks)\n\nAnemia\n\nA:  Appears to have had Hct ~ 35, MCV ~ 73-74 for > 10 years.

I have reviewed or collected the primary data and examined the patient personally.  \n \nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  62 year-old left handed white male (crossed right handed for writing), with bilateral buttock burning dysesthesias radiating down both lateral lower extremities.   \nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old man with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, asthma, hypertension, attention deficit disorder, diabetic neuropathy and obesity who developed two years of gradually progressive discomfort in the lower extremities.  He has gained 40 pounds over the past two years and over that time course has noted that when he stands after about a minute he gets a firing burning pain in the left buttock just lateral to the spine which then radiates down the lateral aspect of the left leg.  If he shifts to his right leg, he gets a similar discomfort one or two minutes later.  This is relieved by sitting.  It will happen when walking as well.  This is distinct from the decrease in sensation and the tingling and cold feeling he gets in his feet due to the diabetic neuropathy.  He has had no back trauma, although he has a torn right ACL in the knee which leads to occasional falls.  Of note, he wears his wallet in his left rear pocket and tightens his belt to keep it at his waist.  \n \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history is as above and also includes a superficial varicosity in the right mid calf.   \nALLERGIES:  Sulfa, contrast medium, Ambien.  \n \nFAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory.  \n \nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Hytrin, Cozaar 50 mg q. day, Ritalin 20 mg five times per day, glucophage 10 mg t.i.d., Rezulin 400 mg t.i.d., Neurontin 600 mg q.h.s. and Selexa.  \n \nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He is getting divorced and has four grown children all in good health.  \n \nBIRTH HISTORY:  He was born with hammer toes and no other family member has this condition.  \n \nEDUCATION:  He is a Consultant who works in Dupont.  \n \nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He has limited exercise and diet.  He has 30+ year history of cigarette smoking and has has no cigarettes in the last six weeks.  He denies alcohol use or recent recreational drug use.  He has no HIV risk factors.  \n \nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  System review reveals normal bowel function with frequent small volume urination.  He attributes this to his Ritalin use and has not seen a urologist.  He has difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection and had only minimal improvement with Viagra.  When walking he develops some symptoms of claudication which were immediately relieved by resting.  There is no cardiovascular, respiratory or constitutional symptoms.  \n \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General: healthy appearance with a blood pressure of 175/90 in the left arm seated.  Pulse of 60 and regular.  Carotids 2+ without bruits.  Mental status:  Unremarkable.  Cranial nerves:  immature cataract, o.s.  No evidence of retinopathy.  \n \nMotor:  normal tone and full strength in upper limbs.  Mild 5-/5 weakness in ankle extension bilaterally.  Mild distal atrophy in the foot intrinsics.  Rapid alternating movements intact.   \nSensation:  decreased to vibration and joint position in the feet bilaterally.  Mild decrease to pin over the medial nerve distribution on the right hand.  \n \nThe muscle stretch reflexes are absent at the Achilles and 1+ at the patellar, brachial radialis, biceps and triceps with flexor, plantar responses.  Finger to nose is accurate in both arms.  Gait is steady but distorted by the knee injury and slightly wide based.  He has a decreased tandem but can heel walk.  He has minimal unsteadiness in the Romberg position.  \n \nDATA REVIEW:  MR imaging of the lumbosacral spine was performed at Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy and then again several days later at Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point (860-721-0108).  Report and films reviewed from Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy demonstrate no obvious focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis but some of the views are suboptimal.  The summary report from Bayonet Point suggests there may be some lumbosacral spinal stenosis and I await faxed copy of that report.  \n \nASSESSMENT:  \n1.  Neuropathy.  The patient has likely multifactorial reasons for his lumbar spine pain.  He did undergo an evaluation by Dr.  Ulysses Harding which is unavailable at this time and one cortisone injection which was not effective at relieving his discomfort.  He likely has a combination of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, sciatic neuropathy and possible lumbosacral spinal stenosis or polyradiculopathy.  There is no evidence of diabetic amyotrophy.  I think at this point, an EMG with nerve conduction studies will be most helpful to identify the relevant contributions of these different factors.  I have also suggested that he invest in suspenders and carry his wallet in a different pocket to see if this will provide some relief.  He has tried a course of non steroidals without effect and I think I would like to begin with a low dose of amitriptyline as a neuropathic pain agent to supplement the Neurontin that he is on for other indications.  I will see him back in the office after the EMG has been performed and I have had a chance to review the MR imaging.  \n \nThank you for sending him to my office, it is a pleasure taking care of this gentleman and I am hopeful that we will be able to reduce his discomfort to some degree.  \n \nThe risks and benefits of any recommended or alternative treatments were discussed.  \n \nDIAGNOSTIC CODE/LEVEL:  C5/peripheral neuropathy.  \n \n \n_______________________________ \nHolland Keller, M.D.  \n \n \n \nDD:01/25/72 \nDT:01/25/72 \nTD:5969:032 \n \n\n\n\n\n",

Huynh, MD\n\nSouth Side Hospital\n\nThoracic Surgery\n\n92 Cleveland Street\n\nMorris, MO 95412\n\n \n\nRE: Otis Narvaez\n\n        MR   #04561326\n\n \n\nDear Dr. Huynh:\n\n \n\nI had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Oscar Narvaez in \n\nconsultation.  As you know he is a 63-year-old gentleman with a history \n\nof diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.  Recently, he underwent \n\nevaluation prior to intestinal bypass surgery in which he underwent \n\ndobutamine stress echocardiography.  The echocardiogram revealed reduced \n\nleft ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 35 to 40 percent.  \n\nThere was no evidence of ischemia.  He subsequently underwent coronary \n\ncatheterization.  I do not have those results, but he claims that he was \n\ntold that he had no arterial blockages.  Symptomatically, he is \n\nsignificantly short of breath with minimal exertion.  He has attributed \n\nthis to his weight.  He was started on an ACE inhibitor and diuretic, \n\nalthough he has not been taking either of these medications.  Prior to \n\nhis catheterization a chest x-ray revealed a 1.5 cm nodule in the left \n\nupper lobe of the lung that was not present in 2067.  This was confirmed \n\nsubsequently on CT scan, suggesting that this was most likely a primary \n\nlung malignancy.  He is therefore scheduled for mediastinoscopy with \n\nyou.\n\n \n\nHis past medical history is remarkable for diabetes, hypertension, low \n\nback pain, and obesity.\n\n \n\nCurrent medications include glucophage 1000 mg po q.d., Ritalin 80 mg po \n\nq.d., Celexa 10 mg po q.d., Neurontin.  No drug allergies\n\n \n\nFamily history is remarkable for heart disease in his father.\n\n \n\nSocial history: he works as a consultant in the Morris area.  He smoked for \n\n40 years but quit approximately three years ago.  He drinks rarely, \n\nalthough drank heavily in the past.\n\n \n\nRE: Otis Narvaez\n\n       MR  #04561326                                      -2-                 \n\n                       \n\nDecember 30,  2072                                         \n\n \n\nReview of systems is remarkable for shortness of breath.  He denies \n\ngastrointestinal complaints.\n\n \n\nOn physical exam he is obese but well appearing with a blood pressure of \n\n140/70 and a pulse of 80 and regular.  HEENT is unremarkable, neck \n\nsupple without thyromegaly, no jugular venous distention, carotids full \n\nwithout bruits, chest clear to auscultation and percussion.Cardiac exam: \n\nregular rate and rhythm, PMI nondisplaced, normal heart sounds, no \n\nmurmurs or rubs.  Abdomen benign nontender without hepatosplenomegaly or \n\nCVA tenderness.  No clubbing cyanosis or edema.  Pulses full.\n\n \n\nImpression: Mr. Narvaez has evidence of decreased left ventricular \n\nfunction by echocardiogram.  By report he has no evidence of coronary \n\nartery disease, although I have not seen this report myself.  If indeed \n\nit is true that he has no coronary artery disease, then my guess is that \n\nthis represents a primary cardiomyopathy or cardiomyopathy secondary to \n\nhis diabetes or even his history of alcohol abuse.  In any case, this \n\nputs them at increased risk for an operation, although probably less so \n\nthan if he had significant coronary disease.  I see no reason why you \n\nshould not proceed with the biopsy that is planned immediately.  Prior \n\nto his operation, he should be placed on ACE inhibitor and diuretic.  \n\nI'll be happy to continue to see him should he care to transfer his care \n\nto South Side Hospital.\n\n \n\nSincerely yours,\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKevin Y. Kirkpatrick, M.D.\n\n \n\n \n\n_______________________________\n\nKirkpatrick,Kevin\n\n \n\nDD: 12/29/72\n\nDT: 12/30/72\n\nDV: 12/29/72\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\n\n\n\n\n",

His previous visit with me occurred on\nFebruary 19, 2077, where his acute complaint was shortness of breath with any activity.  He\ndenied chest pain, but did admit to a \"tight\" feeling down his left arm on occasion.  This was not\nassociated with activity.  He admits to being a very sedentary person.  \n\nThe results of his Adenosine MIBI were abnormal, with abnormal myocardial perfusion, global\nLV function, and CT coronary angiography.  There were no significant findings on the clinical\nevaluation.  The response was non-ischemic, and there were no EKG changes during infusion. \nThe results revealed a small calcified plaque in the proximal LAD coronary artery without flow-\nlimiting stenosis.  There was a more heavily calcified plaque visualized in the distal RCA which\nwas flow-limiting, and there was a moderate amount of stress-induced ischemia on imaging. \nThere was severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 32%.  The\nnarrowing in the distal segment of the RCA was greater than 70%.  \n\nA lipid profile performed following his office visit on February 19, 2077 revealed a total\ncholesterol of 182 mg/dl, an HDL of 43 mg/dl, an LDL of 71 mg/dl, and a triglyceride level of\n342 mg/dl.  He has not been on any cholesterol-lowering medications.  \n\nHe had undergone previous cardiac catheterization in November 2072, which demonstrated\ninsignificant coronary artery disease, with an ejection fraction of 63%.\n\nSince his last office visit, he continues to be significantly short of breath with any activity.  He\ndenies any chest pain or left arm discomfort.  \n\nHis current medications include Ritalin 20 mg five times daily, Ambien 10 mg at hour of sleep,\nNeurontin 900 mg three times daily, Lasix 20 mg every other day, Lisinopril 60 mg once daily, \nOtis Narvaez\nMR #045-61-32-6\nPage 2\nMarch 12, 2077\n \naspirin 325 mg with Oxycodone as needed.  He usually takes these once every other day.  He is\nnow on 20 units of an insulin preparation that he cannot identify.  He takes this at bedtime.\n\nReview of systems reveals that he has chronic peripheral neuropathy in his feet.  This causes him\nto feel imbalanced, and it is necessary for him to walk with a cane.\n\nHe was diagnosed with diabetes in 2068 and hypertension in 2067.  He also has chronic low\nback pain due to degenerative joint disease, as well as lumbar disc disease.  He also has\ndegenerative joint disease in his knees.  He receives psychiatric follow-up for his diagnosis of\ndepression.  \n\nHe underwent a gastric bypass procedure at Harmon Medical Rehabilitation Hospital in 2068.\n\nOn January 20, 2073, he underwent a left lingular-sparing upper lobectomy for a T1 squamous\ncell carcinoma.  \n\nOn physical examination, he appears healthy, albeit overweight, with a normal affect.  His\nweight is 208 lbs, the heart rate is 84 beats per minute, the respiratory rate is 16 per minute, and\nthe blood pressure is 140/62 mm/Hg.  Examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat\nreveals upper dentures in place.  There is no jugular vein distention, and the lungs are clear. \nThere is increased AP diameter with bilateral gynecomastia.  On cardiac examination, the heart\nsounds are distant, and there is a regular rhythm, a normal S1, a single S2, and no murmurs,\nrubs, or gallops.  The lower extremity examination reveals a 2 cm tender superficial area on the\ndistal right calf.  There is no edema noted.\n\nI discussed with Otis Narvaez and his wife, Santiago, my recommendations for a cardiac\ncatheterization followed by stent placement, as indicated.  He has agreed to this, and Dr. Yaziel\nKraft will perform the procedure.  His office will call Mr. Narvaez to schedule the\ncatheterization.  After leaving the office today, he will have a CBC, a PT, a PTT, and a\ncomprehensive metabolic profile performed.  He will return to see me in the office again in one\nmonth.\n\nBest personal regards.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nKenneth Z. Sellers, M.D.\n/huff\n\n\nCharlene B. Bates, RN, BSN\nScribe for Kenneth Z. Sellers, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n",

Hidradenitis.  \n \nMeds:  Colchicine 0.6 mg q.d.  \n \nALL:  None.\n \nFH:  Father died at 57 from an MI.  Mother at 60 in her sleep. \nBrothers have gout, one has hypertension.\n \nSH:  Married for the second time.  His wife is Emily Ippolito another\npatient of mine.  They will have been married for one year in May. \nHe works as a Patternmaker for McCall in Enid.  He averages 1 1/2\npacks of cigarettes a day for the last 35 years.  No alcohol.  No drugs\nor HIV exposure.\n \nROS:  Bifocals. Slightly decreased hearing in the left ear.  No chest\npain.  Has a chronic AM cough bringing up 1/4 cup of phlegm daily.  He\noccasionally plays tennis and bicycles.  He believes his cholesterol\nwas 170.  Does like high cholesterol food but has cut back because his\nwife has a problem.  He uses seat belts.\n \nOn physical examination he is a very pleasant large white male.  His\nweight is 222 lbs., blood pressure 128/88, heart rate 72.  HEENT -\nEOMI, PERL, fundi negative.  Cerumen impacted against the TM's.  Benign\noral cavity examination.  No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Lungs\nclear.  No murmurs or gallops.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No testicular\nmasses or hernias.  Normal prostate, guaiac negative stool.   Absent\ndistal pulses.  2+ femoral pulses without any bruits.  1+ reflexes.  No\nswelling or tenderness over the first MTP's.  Neurologic exam shows\nhearing decreased to watch tick bilaterally.  Air conduction is greater\nthan bone.  Weber is not lateralized.  \n \nImpressions and plans:  1.  Gout.  It sounds like this is really not\nmuch of a problem when he remembers to take the Colchicine.  I\nencouraged him to make this a regular habit.  We will check a random\nuric acid level.\n \n2.  Cardiac risk factors.  He is a male with a very positive family\nhistory who is a smoker.  He has significant cardiac risk factors.  We\nspent a long time talking about smoking today.  At his request I gave\nhim a prescription for Nicoderm patches.  He will start at 21 mg for\nsix weeks and then move to 14 mg for 2 weeks and 7 mg for 2 weeks.  We\nwill check a cholesterol and he should be less than 200 given his risk\nfactors.  I pointed out to him his evidence by history of chronic\nbronchitis and of peripheral vascular disease.  I think he found this\nsobering.\n \n3.  General health.  We discussed exercise, cholesterol and seat belts.\nWe also discussed the use of Q-Tips which I think may also be a\nsignificant contributing factor to his decreased hearing and the\nimpaction of cerumen.  I recommended ear drops.  We can have him tested\nformally when he becomes interested in intervention.\n \n \n \n \nXzavior C.

Unfortunately, he\narrived 24 hours late.  \n \nHe is gradually recovering from a recent flare of his COPD.  This\nstarted with an upper respiratory infection.  He called over the\nweekend and was started on prednisone.  He continued to have a\nstuttering course over the course of that following week and came\nto urgent care the following weekend.  There he was treated with\nnebulizers.  He reports that today he was finally able to blow 350\non his peak flow meter.  He is still bringing up lots of junk.  His\ngout has been quiescent.  \n \nMedications:  Albuterol.  Azmacort.  Colchicine.  Enalapril.  \n \nAllergies:  None.\n \nSocial History:  Married.  His adoption of a 10-year-old girl named\nXiao has been finalized.  He is employed as a sales representative and that\nrequires a lot of lifting and carrying.  He quit smoking three and\na half years ago.  He drinks no alcohol.\n \nPhysical Examination:  Looks well.  His weight is 222 pounds.  His\nblood pressure is 124/82.  Pulse 76.  HEENT:  EOMI.  No scleral\nicterus.  No lymphadenopathy.  His lungs are completely clear\nposteriorly and anteriorly.  Distant heart sounds without any\naudible murmurs.  Benign abdomen without any hepatomegaly.  No\nrectal masses.  Normal prostate.  Guaiac negative stool.  No pedal\nedema.  \n \nOxygen saturation on room air is 97 percent.  Peak flow is 320. \n \nImpression: \n1.  COPD.  We discussed this at length.  I think the crucial\ncomponent to his treatment will be to anticipate when he is going\nto have a flare and responding quickly in a preventative fashion. \nWe will have him check his peak flows at the same time every day. \nWhen he is feeling well his peak flows are always in the 350 range\nand he reports that they never go to 300.  When it hits 300 he\nshould call me or if it is the weekend, he should start immediately\non prednisone 40 mg a day.  \n2.  Gout.  Doing well on colchicine.  \n3.  Hypertension.  Well controlled.  I will check a creatinine.\n4.  General health.  We will check a cholesterol.  His cholesterols\nhave been good in the past but he has a slightly low HDL.\n \n \n \nGregg, Lloyd\nMR #657-72-75-7\n06/14/80\npage 2\n \nXzavior C.

When he\n\nreturns home from work he cooks dinner and this\n\ncombined with his work schedule and picking up his\n\ndaughter from school and walking the dog has prohibited\n\nhim from a regular exercise program.  Needless to say,\n\nhe has remained active.  He is not limited in these\n\nactivities by his respiratory function with the\n\nexception of some periodic exacerbation of dyspnea with\n\nheavy lifting.  He uses albuterol during these\n\ninstances anywhere between 0 and 2 to 3 times per day. \n\nHis usual peak expiratory flow rate is roughly 300-350\n\nliters per minute.  He knows that when his PEFR falls\n\nto below 250 for 3 days in a row to contact you for\n\nadvice as well as burst of prednisone and he has had 1\n\nburst of prednisone since our last visit in April.\n\n \n\nHis medical regimen is notable for Flovent 220\n\nmicrograms per puffs, 2 puffs twice a day, Serevent MDI\n\n2 puffs twice a day, Allopurinol, colchicine, Vasotec\n\nand the albuterol as mentioned above. \n\n \n\nRE: Lloyd Gregg            -2-  November 29,2083 \n\n    MR#65772757\n\n \n\nThe patient's review of systems is notable for the absence of\n\nfevers, chills, sweats, chest discomfort, symptoms of GERD,\n\nchange in his bowel or bladder habits or weight.  He does\n\ncontinue to have nearly continuous post nasal drip which leads to\n\nfrequent clearing of his throat and occasional cough.  There is\n\nno hemoptysis or significant sputum production.\n\n \n\nOn physical exam, he appears well, is in no respiratory distress. \n\nNC/AT, PERRL, EOMI, AS, pink conjunctiva.  TM's are clear with\n\nnormal light reflexes bilaterally.  His nasal mucosa is notable\n\nfor mild erythema bilaterally with a clear nasal discharge.  No\n\nsignificant LAN in the cervical or supraclavicular axillary\n\nchains.  Chest exam reveals an increased AP diameter and\n\nprolongation of his expiratory phase.  He has an occasional\n\nexpiratory wheeze.  There are no focal findings of consolidation\n\nand air movement is moderate.  No significant JVD and he has a\n\nregular rate and rhythm with an S4, S1, a normally split S2 and\n\nthere are no murmurs, rubs or S3.  Abdomen is benign without HSM,\n\nfocal tenderness or masses.  His extremities are without\n\nclubbing, cyanosis or edema.  His weight is 223 pounds. \n\nTemperature 97.1 degrees, pulse 86 per minute, BP 142/82 and his\n\nrespiratory rate is 20 with a room air resting oxygen saturation\n\nof 97 percent.\n\n \n\nMy impression is that the patient's severe airflow obstruction\n\nsecondary to emphysema is stable on his current medical regimen. \n\nI once again encouraged him to continue to lead robust and active\n\nlife.  We agreed that the current action plan for a burst of\n\nprednisone is appropriate and I also have provided him my contact\n\ninformation in the event that he cannot reach you in the midst of\n\na flare.  I have refilled all of his current prescriptions.  To\n\ntry and prevent him from requiring these frequent bursts of\n\nprednisone through the winter months, we have also begun\n\nCombivent 2 puffs 4 times a day as well as Nasonex nasal spray to\n\nbe used 2 puffs in each nostril once a day.  We talked about\n\nvaccinations and he reported that he has recently received the\n\ninfluenza vaccine and he has previously received the pneumonia\n\nvaccine.\n\n \n\nThank you for allowing me to participate in Mr. Gregg's care. \n\nHe will follow up with us on a routine basis in 6 month's time\n\nbut will contact us sooner should he develop more symptoms of a\n\nflare of his COPD.  \n\nRE: Lloyd Gregg            -3-            November 29, 2083 \n\n    MR#65772757\n\n \n\nWith best regards, \n\n \n\n \n\nThomas Iyer, M.D.\n\n/felder\n\n \n\n \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\nRecord date: 2084-08-25\n\n61 yo man with CAD and PVD referred by Dr. Short for pre-operative evaluation prior to vascular surgery.\n\n\n\nHe has a long hx of ischemic ulcer of the second toe of the right foot. He was admitted to the vascular service on 8/09 and had an arteriogram that showed complete occlusion of the SFA with reconstitution of the popliteal and single vessel run off. His pre-operative EKG raised the possibility of old ASMI although it was unchanged for a number of years. He underwent dobutamine MIBI which showed a moderate area of severe ischemia in the LAD territory. His LV was normal with EF of 59%. He underwent cath which showed complete occlusion of the LAD with collaterals from a fairly large diagonal that also had a tight stenosis. There were lower grade occlusions in the RCA territory and the LCX. He had been asymptomatic. The LAD lesion was long and totalled and not felt to be amenable to angioplasty. There were no indications to have him undergo CABG so the decision was made to PTCA the diagonal lesion to improve flow to the anterior wall. He tolerated this well. Returns today feeling well and has been active painting his fence and going up and down stairs without any chest pains or unusual SOB. Has had a hematoma in the groin.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Serevent.  Flovent.  Enalapril.  Colchicine. Alopurinol.\n\nAlbuterol.  Viagra.\n\n \n\nALLERGIES:  None. \n\n \n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Father died at 57 after his 8th MI.  He had his\n\nfirst one at age 48.  Mother had a stroke in her early 50s.  His brother, Shields,\n\ndied a miserable death with recurrent, inoperable laryngeal cancer.\n\n \n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Married.  Continues to work as a sales representative.  He\n\nhas an adopted child, Xiao who is now 14 and doing very well in school. Quit smoking and drinking a number of years ago.\n\n \n\n\n\nROS: No chest pains. Chronic shortness of breath. No bowel problems. No bladder problems. Does not exercise. Last cholesterol was  175/42.     The rest of the review of systems was negative. \n\n\n\nPE: General: Looks well.\n\n================ Vital signs ================\n\nBlood Pressure:   150/80 142/80   130/78\n\nPulse:   84   [Regular, Radial]\n\nWeight:   222   [Pounds]\n\nSkin: Chronic ischemic ulcer on the medial aspect of his second toe of the right foot.\n\nHEENT: EOMI. PEERL. No scleral icterus. Bilateral cataracts. Benign pharynx.\n\nNeck: No lymphadenopathy. No thyromegaly. No cartotid bruits.\n\nLungs: Decreased breath sounds. Wheezes.\n\nCor: JVP is normal. PMI is not displaced. Heart sounds barely audible No murmurs. No gallops.\n\nAbd: Normal bowel sounds. No hepatomegaly. No splenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness.\n\nHe has a small echymosis of the left inguinal area. Bilateral femoral bruits. 1+ right femoral pulse. I cannot palpate the left pulse.\n\nExtremities: No pedal edema. Ulcer as above.\n\n\n\nEKG done in the office shows NSR at 74. Axis 90. Normal intervals. He has Q's in V1-V2 c/w possible OASMI. He has low volts in the precordial leads c/w chronic pulmonary disease. No changes from previous.\n\n\n\n================ Problems ================\n\nPRE-OP EVALUATION   He has rest ischemia of the toe. He has three vessel coronary disease that is asymptomatic. There are no indications at this time to push for CABG. He underwent angioplasty to try to improve flow to the anterior wall. His EKG suggests OASMI but his ventriculogram is normal without evidence of MI and EF of 59%. There are studies showing increased risk of in-stent thrombosis, MI, death in patients who have had Plavix stopped for non-cardiac surgery within two weeks of stent. He will be beyond the two week period and Dr. Short is willing to operate on him while continuing Plavix and aspirin. I believe he is an acceptable risk for surgery.\n\n\n\nPVD   Will need surgery for ischemic ulcer.\n\n\n\nCOPD   Doing well and is stable. Instructed to use his inhalers faithfully in the preop period.\n\n       \n\nGOUT    No flares this year.\n\n      \n\nHYPERTENSION    Better when rechecked. He gets nervous with the initial measurements.\n\n      \n\nIMPOTENCE         Discussed the fact that, now that he has documented CAD, there is increased risk with Viagra use. He understands that but indicates that he feels that for him personally the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________                              \n\n\n\nWelch, Xzavior Charles, M.D.\n\n\n\ncc: Dr. Farris Short\n\n     Vascular Surgery\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Has been coughing for a month. Yellow sputum. Has not gone on steroids. Every year this happens once. Viagra is working sometimes at 50 sometimes at 100. Apparently bone packing did not have the desired result of his cystic lesion but he tolerates this.\n\n\n\nPMH:\n\nHe has a long hx of ischemic ulcer of the second toe of the right foot. He was admitted to the vascular service on 8/09/84 and had an arteriogram that showed complete occlusion of the SFA with reconstitution of the popliteal and single vessel run off. His pre-operative EKG raised the possibility of old ASMI although it was unchanged for a number of years. He underwent dobutamine MIBI which showed a moderate area of severe ischemia in the LAD territory. His LV was normal with EF of 59%. He underwent cath which showed complete occlusion of the LAD with collaterals from a fairly large diagonal that also had a tight stenosis. There were lower grade occlusions in the RCA territory and the LCX. He had been asymptomatic. The LAD lesion was long and totalled and not felt to be amenable to angioplasty. There were no indications to have him undergo CABG so the decision was made to PTCA the diagonal lesion to improve flow to the anterior wall. He tolerated this well. \n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Serevent.  Flovent.  Enalapril.  Colchicine. Alopurinol.\n\nAlbuterol.  Viagra. Aspirin. \n\n \n\nALLERGIES:  None. \n\n \n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Father died at 57 after his 8th MI.

He\n\nhas an adopted child, Xiao who is now 15 and doing very well as an honor student. She is going to the Summer Institute for the Gifted. He quit smoking and drinking a number of years ago.\n\n \n\nROS: No chest pains. Chronic shortness of breath. No bowel problems. No bladder problems. Off exercise since fracture.  The rest of the review of systems was negative. \n\n\n\nPE: General: Looks well.\n\n\n\n================ Vital signs ================\n\nBlood Pressure:   130/70   [Left Arm, Sitting]\n\nPulse:   78   [Regular, Radial]\n\nWeight:   215   [Pounds]\n\nSkin: No break down.\n\nHEENT: EOMI. PEERL. No retinopathy. No scleral icterus. Benign pharynx.\n\nNeck: No lymphadenopathy. No thyromegaly. No cartotid bruits.\n\nLungs: Decreased breath sounds. No wheezes.\n\nCor: JVP is normal. PMI is not displaced. Heart sounds barely audible except in epigastrium. No murmurs. No gallops.\n\nAbd: Normal bowel sounds. No hepatomegaly. No splenomegaly. No masses.

        "text": "\n\n\nRecord date: 2094-07-22\n\nCARDIOLOGY\n\nPERHAM MERITCARE CLINIC\n\n\n\nReason for visit:\n\n   Ms. Neill came into the emergency room even though she was feeling fine because she insists that she wanted to see me today even though it is not an office day.  She was instructed to come to the office and I was able to see her in between catheterization cases\n\n\n\nInterval History:\n\n   Ms. Neill was recently evaluated at Janesville Clinic for her dyspnea.  She was concerned that her dyspnea was related to her lungs and I believe self referred to Janesville for further evaluation.  \n\n\n\nShe was found by cardiac echo there to have significant decrease in her ejection fraction to 15%.  Previously here last fall her ejection fraction measured 43%.  She had global hypokinesis.\n\n\n\nShe was hospitalized at Janesville and had an abnormal set of pulmonary function tests showing moderate restrictive disease.  She had some air trapping and was noted to have room air saturation 97% at rest, 94% with exertion.  Lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT.  d dimer 400 rnage.  BNP elevated at 500.  VQ scan showed possible perfusion defect in the left lower lobe.  Previous CTA in the emergency room had been negative for pulmonary embolus.  Because of continued suspicion about PE she underwent pulmonary arterogram which was unremarkable.  A repeat VQ scan after a normal PA gram showed some persistence in the left lower lobe defect and ultimately it was felt that she did not have evidence of any thromboembolic pulmonary vascular disease.  Of note pulmonary artery pressure was approximately 50 at the time of PA gram.\n\n\n\nThe patient was commenced on Lasix 20mg.  Her Atenolol was changed to Toprol.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately she does not bring with her a complete list of her medications today although she relates that she is taking:\n\nLasix 20mg\n\nToprol XL 50mg\n\nASA 325mg\n\nZestril 20mg\n\nLantus 10 units hs\n\nGlucovance 2.5/500mg\n\nMultivitamin\n\n\n\nShe relates that her dyspnea is better\n\n\n\nShe is extremely reluctant to undergo Cardiac catheterization at this time despite recommendation on my part.  She would much prefer cardiac echo and if there is improvement, continued medical therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\nPast medical history:\n\n   1. Diabetes\n\n2. Hypertension\n\n3. Hyperlipidemia\n\n4. Sick Sinus syndrome requiring permanant pacemaker\n\n5. cardiomypathy\n\n6. Minimal CAD by cath 2090\n\n\n\nFamily history:\n\n   No significant cardiac disease\n\n\n\nSocial history:\n\n   She and her husband are doing well.  She has retired. Daughter is finished with college and Quarry Worker in the Bristow area.\n\n\n\nReview of systems:\n\n   Patinet is improved with regard to exertional tolerance as noted.  Denies edema, PND, orthopnea.  Still has dyspnea with walking flat ground but not until 1-2 blocks.\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n-BP: 130/80  \n\n-General appearance:   No acute distress.\n\n-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.\n\n-Heent:   Unremarkable\n\n-Neck:   CVP 8.  No carotid bruits\n\n-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.\n\n-Cardiac:   S1 S2.   No significant murmurs.  PMI normal.\n\n-Abdomen:   Obese, soft, no hepatosplenomegly\n\n-Extremities:   Good pulses, no edema\n\n-Neuro:   Non-focal\n\n-Pulse: 89  \n\n\n\nEKG:\n\n   Atrial triggered ventricular pacing with borderline first degree AV block.\n\n\n\nImpression:\n\n   Ms. Neill is very reluctant regarding angiography despite a drop in her ejection fraction.\n\n\n\nHer evaluation at Janesville Clinic for thromboembolic pulmonary disease was unremarkable.\n\n\n\nShe was found to have a markedly positive ANA at 1-1280 with a speckled pattern and single stranded DNA postive.  Further markers etc are not available to me at this time.\n\n\n\nAt this point, repeat cardiac echo at our institution will be obtained.\n\n\n\nDepending upon the results I will again approach the patient regarding considering Cardiac catheterization although in truth her pattern in LV dysfunction is more suggestive of recurrent myocarditis/undetermined cardiomyopathy than coronary disease.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the patient relates that she stopped Lipitor due to myalgia and that she is taking a differrent cholesterol tablet at this time although once again she unable to name the medication.  She relates that she will call our office.\n\n\n\nSigned electronically by   Samantha G Noland MD  on  Jul 27, 2094     \n\n\n\n",

Normal appearance to the left \n\n     vertebral artery which courses to become the basal artery without \n\n     evidence of occlusion or significant stenosis.  The other \n\n     intracranial arteries demonstrate no evidence of significant stenosis \n\n     or occluded segment.  No aneurysm is visualized.  \n\n      \n\n     CTA NECK: Moderate stenosis of the proximal right cervical vertebral \n\n     artery secondary to atherosclerotic disease.

        "text": "\n\n\nRecord date: 2085-04-22\n\n \nThis patient wants to transfer his care from the McCook Erie Clinic to me. He \ngot \nmy name from a nurse who works in the hospital.  HE is a 58 year old white \nmale retired Transportation Manager with a number of issues.  \n1)  He had a cyst or a mass enlarge in his R submental region which was \nexcised \nat the McCook Erie Clinic.  Note from his surgeon there said the path showed \nnonkaziating granuloma.  I hope cultures are pending.  The patient does \nvolunteer at a homeless shelter so could  certainly be exposed to TB or \natypical mycobacteria.  \n2)  The patient has know mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation followed \nat the MEC by a cardiologist. He had a stress test in the last year that was \nbenign. Never had CHF or endocarditis.  \n3)  Social situation.  The patient is a sober alcoholic and sober for the \nlast \n2 years however he went through divorce probably because of his alcoholism \n10 years ago and took early retirement from Brookdale Metro Systems because \nof his alcoholism. He stays sober by going to meetings and also \nvolunteering at the McCook Clinic. He lives with a woman. He has good \nrelations with his grown children and his grand children.  His woman friend \nis very supportive and the patient is now feeling good enough about himself \nthat he is ready to try and get work full time.  Previous attempts to do so \nhave resulted in failure because of his Hx of alcoholism and his premature \nretirement.\n \nFamily Hx. Father died at age 79 of Altzheimers and some kind of cancer ? \nthroat cancer.  His mother had diabetes and coronary artery disease and she \ndied of colon cancer. The patient himself had a colonoscopy within the last \nyear and it was normal.  One brother and 2 sisters, one of the sisters also \nhas mitral valve disease. \n \nPast medical Hx the alcoholism and he was stabbed in the L hand I think in \n2059 and that was repaired. He also had a TNA in childhood. \n \nHe has no known allergies to medications.\n \nThe only medication he takes is Lisinopril 5 mg for blood pressure. He was \nonly started on this in the last year. He also takes a vitamin a day.\n \nHis other significant medical complaint is erectile dysfunction.  He has \nnormal libido and good sexual drive however he tends to lose erection after \nhe \nhas gone for a few minutes.  He can achieve vaginal penetration.  His live in \nlover has been supportive but she would like him to have better performance \nand so would he. He does wake up in the morning frequently with erections. He \nhas no known Hx of diabetes.  No prolonged hypertension or vascular disease.  \n \nSocial Hx.  The patient eats fairly well. He walks usually a mile or so a \nday.  \nHe does not do any aerobic activity. He does smoke  to a pack a day and has \nfor many, many years.  He does wear seat belts when he drives and does not do \nany elicit drugs.  On system review:  Weight stable.  No change in skin. He \nalways had a very gravelly voice.  He has had no change in his vision. He is \nvery deaf in the L ear.  He has a morning cough no hemoptysis.  Cough is \nabout \na teaspoon of white/gray sputum. He has no dyspnea on exertion.  He has no \nangina.  No palpitations.  No presyncope or syncope.  NO claudication. He has \nno dysphagia. He has no epigastric discomfort.  No change in his bowel \nmovements and no rectal bleeding.  He has no claudication.  No edema and no \njoint pains. No headaches and no low back pain.  No long bone pain.  He has \nno \nheat or cold intolerance.  He has no easy bruisability.  \n \nPE: shows him to 5'7\".  155 lbs.  Skin benign.  Nails do show some early \nclubbing. No cyanosis.  Normal no AV knicking.  Flat disks. Pupils equally \nround and reactive to light and accommodation at 3 mm. Nares normal.  TMs \nnormal. Hearing is markedly diminished in the L ear. Head is normal cephalic. \nThyroid not enlarged.  There is the scar at the site of his excision under \nthe \nmandible. No associated adenopathy on either R or L neck or axilla or the \nsupraclavicular region.  He is hyperesonant to percussion.  He has distant \nbreath sounds. No rales, rhonchi or wheezes. He has normal S1.  Normal S2 and \nholosystolic blowing 2-3/6 mid systolic murmur radiates best to the axilla. \nNo \nradiation to the clavicles. No carotid bruits.  Jugular venous pulsation to 7 \nsonometers. Abdomen is soft and non tender. There is no enlargement of the \nliver. No adeventitious masses. There is a L inguinal weakness without frank \nhernia.  Phallus uncircumsized. Testes normal. Prostate is a little difficult \nfeel because he has a band around the anal sphincter which makes it difficult \nfor me to get beyond but I felt probably half of his prostate and it was \nnormal and smooth. Stool was guac negative. Reflexes 3+ and equal throughout \nand normal vibratory sense and touch. Normal gait and station.\n \nAssessment and Plan:\n \n1)  Recent rapidly growing mass under the R mandible showing nonkaziating \ngranuloma.  Culture is pending and we will plant a PPD and control early \nnext week. I will have him tracked down the report of this from the MEC and \nget culture reports and will get chest x-ray today both for his COPD to \nrule out a cavitary lesion.  \n2)  Alcoholism now sober.\n3)  Erectile dysfunction try Viagra. He was given appropriate warnings and \ninstructions.  I gave him 100 mg # 7.  \n4)  Mitral valve prolapse by auscultation followed by cardiologist at the MEC.\n5)  We spent a long time talking about smoking cessation.  He has some \nWellbutrin at home from when he was depressed while getting sober and I \nencouraged him to take 150 b.i.d. and we made a plan for him to try and \nquit.   I will see patient again next week to plant a PPD and then see him \nagain in about a month to see how he is doing.  We will certainly check the \nchest x-ray to make sure he did not have active cavitary disease.\n \nLeroy X. Oshea, M.D.\n \n \n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\n\n\n\n",

Cardiomegaly. \n\n       \n\n&#183; EKG: Regular rate, sinus rhythm, indeterminate versus right axis. Frequent PVCs, Anterior Q waves, prolonged QT\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN: 66 yo m w/ likely new onset CHF.  Given his exam, I would favor systolic heart failure &gt; diastolic heart failure, although he has features going for both.  Features going for systolic are his widely displaced PMI and the fact that he had a mildly dilated LV on an echo in 2092.\n\n\n\nI think he most likely has dilated cardiomyopathy 2/2 mitral regurgitation, which was moderate to severe in 2092.  His murmur is quite impressive.  Another possibility is alcoholic cardiomyopathy.  Ischemia is not out of the question given his age and risk factors. He is also a smoker.  \n\n\n\nAnother possibility is diastolic failure given his hypertension and likely diabetes.\n\n\n\n1.        CHF &#8211; Still quite volume overloaded on exam.  Will give another dose of lasix 40 IV tonight.  Start captopril 6.25 q8 to also control BP.  Repeat echo in the am.  Strict I/Os, fluid restriction, low fat, low salt diet.  If EF is depressed, will start beta blocker, consider aldactone.\n\n2.        Substance abuse &#8211; Will obtain Johnson Rehab consult for alcohol and cigarettes.\n\n3.        HTN &#8211; Poorly controlled, captopril\n\n4.        Elevated blood sugar &#8211; Will obtain fasting BSs and right for sliding scale insulin.  Will obtain HgbA1C\n\n5.        Hyperlipidemia &#8211; LDL 128 in 2090.  Will start statin and check fasting lipid panel in am.\n\n6.        Restless leg syndrome &#8211; Likely 2/2 iron deficiency anemia.  Will replete till ferritin &gt; 50 before treating\n\n7.        Iron deficiency anemia &#8211; Will start iron sulfate, recheck ferritin.\n\n\n\nF/E/N:  low salt, low fat/cholesterol diet\n\n\n\nPROPHYLAXIS:    GI: none   DVT: fragmin    BOWEL: colace/senna   CODE:  FULL  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________\n\nIvory Barron MD \n\nPGY-1  Pager # 60809\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I have reviewed\n\nher note and assessment and plan, and I agree.  I have seen and\n\nevaluated the patient myself.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old\n\ngentleman with past medical history of alcoholism, as well as\n\ndepression.  He has had a small-bowel obstruction in the past as\n\nwell as CABG x2, PTSD, and high cholesterol, now presenting to\n\nthe Emergency Room in the setting of having been separated from\n\nhis girlfriend of 15 years secondary to his excessive alcohol use\n\nand drinking very heavily over the last week.  He was found in a\n\nbar intoxicated, and upon EMS arrival stated that he wanted help\n\nwith his drinking problem as well as the fact that he was\n\ndepressed without any SI or HI.  He is also stating that he has\n\nnot taken any food in the last week, just alcohol.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He is denying any chest pain, shortness of\n\nbreath, any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, any headache or blurred\n\nvision or any fall or trauma.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  As above.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  He is on unknown medications.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known allergies.\n\nALLERGIES:  Current heavy alcohol use.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Does smoke cigarettes, but does not use illicit\n\ndrugs.  He is a retired transporation manager, and he was previously\n\nliving with his girlfriend, but has now been living alone for the\n\nlast week.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  When he presented, he had a heart rate of\n\n65, respiratory rate of 16, BP of 150/79, and saturating 99% on\n\nroom air.  He was afebrile at 96.7.  He was alert, interactive,\n\nappropriate, somewhat slurred speech, but gave a good history of\n\nsigns and symptoms.  HEENT exam:  He is nonicteric with dry\n\nmucous membranes.  Heart was regular rhythm, no murmurs.  Lungs\n\nwere clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft and\n\nminimally diffusely tender.  He had no evidence of trauma and\n\npain to palpation in his extremities.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a patient with severe alcohol\n\nabuse, now presenting in the setting of an alcohol binge with no\n\np.o. food intake.  We did send laboratory studies notable for an\n\nelevated white count of 9 as well as hyponatremia at 124, down\n\nfrom 135 previously.  Please see the resident note for full\n\ndetails.  His alcohol level was 277.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  We did treat the patient with IV\n\nfluid as well as D5.  We did give him a p.o. diet here in the\n\nEmergency Department and we monitored him for withdrawal signs. \n\nIn addition, we contacted social work for help with his alcohol\n\ndependence/abuse, and he will be admitted to the Ochsner for\n\nfurther management of his hyponatremia as well as his alcohol\n\nabuse.  We also treated him with multivitamins.\n\nDIAGNOSES:\n\n1.  Alcohol intoxication\n\n2.  Alcohol dependence\n\n3.  Depression.\n\n4.  Hyponatremia.\n\n______________________________\n\nOXENDINE, LAWRENCE MD\n\nD: 04/22/95\n\nT: 04/22/95\n\nDictated By: OXENDINE, LAWRENCE\n\neScription document:1-81539559 HFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\n\n\n\n\n",

There is no evidence of new or recurrent\n     disease.\n     No suspicious mass, calcifications or architectural distortion are\n     identified in the right breast.  A clip and calcifications are\n     noted in the upper outer quadrant from prior benign percutaneous\n     biopsy.\n     There is no mammographic evidence of malignancy in the right\n     breast.\n     \n\nIMPRESSION\n     Post treatment changes involving the left breast with no evidence\n     of new or recurrent disease.\n     No mammographic evidence of malignancy in the right breast.\n     BI-RADS Category 2 Benign Finding\n     \n     \nRADIOLOGISTS:                           SIGNATURES:\n     XI, KATHERINE I                              XI, KATHERINE I\n \n\n\nImpression and Plan:\n\n1) Uncontrolled DM: A bit improved. Now with premeal values mostly in low 200s. Will increase to 1000 mg qpm since her AM values seem to be higest. Eventually will need to be on maximal doses of metformin (2550 mg qd). Hypoglycemic event management reviewed.\nStill with frequent dietary indiscretions, such as eating candy and pizza on regular basis.\n\n2) Diet modification reviewed.\n\n3) HTN/proteinuria: Not optimally controlled. WIll add atenolol for now. Rationale for this reviewed with pt. Cont. ACEI and adjust next time based on microalbumin. Previously referred to renal for eval.\n\n4) Osteoporosis: Stable. Cont. Fosamax. Reviewd proper use-drinking of water and staying upright for at least 30 minutes after taking pill.\n\n5) Smoking: 5 cigs per day per pt. Risks and options discussed. Urged cessation. \n\n6) H/o breast cancer: Stable. F/u with Queen Newton 9/73 and Dr.Mitchell 12/73.\n\n7) abnormal LFTs: recheck in a couple of months.\n\n8) H/o noncompliance: reviewed in detail with pt. \"busy schedule of appts\". Urged compliance.\n\nEncounter 40 min. more than 1/2 of it in face to face review of meds, education/counseling about DM management, rationale for medical regimen, HTN, compliance issues, smoking cessation and above.\n\n\n_____________________________________________\nNoah K.

CXR: Lungs:  The lungs are satisfactorily inflated. There is increasing\nprominence of the interstitium and peribronchial cuffing when compared to the prior study consistent with interval development of CHF.  Surgical clips are again noted projected over the left lower hemithorax.  No definite focal consolidation is demonstrated. Pleura:  There is no pneumothorax. The hemidiaphragms are very slightly less distinct than on the comparison study.  This could be related to the onset of parenchymal changes of CHF, but could also be related to a small amount of pleural fluid. IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with CHF.\n\n\n2. Bilateral LENIs: NO EVIDENCE OF FEMORAL OR POPLITEAL DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS OF\nEITHER LEG.\n\n\nEKG: Normal sinus rhythm at 95. Normal axis. Normal PR, QRS, QT intervals. No ST elevations or depressions.  ? Q waves in v1, v2, v3 but also may be upslopes before the downslops. However new since 12/12/2074\n\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN\n\n\nMrs. Ito is a 69F with a history of CHF (EF 40%, no home O2), DM type 2, HTN, nephritic syndrome, and 1/15/2075 R humerus ORIF presenting from Crest Nursing Home with SOB and HTN. Her exam and imaging is consistent with pulmonary edema, as she has had in the past. The precipitant of her flash pulmonary edema is less clear, however. She describes waking up acutely short of breath and was found to be profoundly hypertensive. It is possible that HTN 2/2 a change in her diet or fluid intake at rehab, ischemia, increases renin-aldo, or other cause led to flash pulmonary edema.  Conversely, however, CHF may have precipitated her HTN.\n \n1. Shortness of breath/CHF: Evidence of volume overload by exam and imaging. PE also on the differential but seems less likely given improvement of resp status, negative LENIs. \n-- Lasix 40mg IV now \n-- Strict I+O\n-- Daily weights\n-- F/up PA/Lat\n-- Continuous O2 sat monitor;Telemetry, cardiac monitor\n-- f/up cardiac enzymes\n-- ASA 325 qd\n-- Will give Lopressor 25 Q8 and Captopril 50 Q8 for now but may need to reconsider the BB if CHF less compensated. \n-- Albuterol and atrovent for possible COPD component given tobacco history\n-- Consider TTE in AM\n-- Consider PFTs\n\n\n2. Leukocytosis: Infection vs stress response. Patient presents with elevated WBC with 80% polys. Infectious work-up has included U/A that is negative for infection. CXR does not show evidence of focal consolidation, however may be obscured by pulmonary edema. Mental status at baseline. I am suspicious for PNA given her report of productive cough howeve do not feel pressed to treat at this time as she is afeb. \n-- Cont to follow fever curve and WBC\n-- F/up PA/Lat\n-- Consider addition of abx for HAP if fever, PA/lat concerning\n-- F/up Blood cultures and sputum cultures\n-- F/up c diff\n\n\n3. Hypertension: Home HTN regimen is Atenolol 50mg QD, HCTZ 25 qday, Lisinopril 40 qday, Losartan 50 BID\n-- Start Captoril 50 mg Q8 and Lopressor 25 q8 and titrate up as needed fo tight BP control \n-- Cardiac monitor\n\n\n4. DM type 2: Home regimen is Metformin/Glucotrol. \n-- D/c oral agents and start Insulin SS w BID BS\n\n\n5. Hematuria/Proteinuria on U/A: Consisent with prior U/A\n\n\n6. Breast CA: Cont Arimidex (hormone tx)\n\n\n7. HL: Cont statin\n\n\n8. Depression: Cont Prozac\n\n\n9. Tobacco use: Cont Chantix 0.5 mg PO QDay\n\n\n10. Anxiety: Ativan PRN at home. \n \n11. FEN:  Low chol, low sat fat, ADA diet with no added salt. Cont Vit D/ Calcium\n \n12. PROPHYLAXIS:\nGI:  Not indicated    DVT: Heparin 5000 Units SC BID    BOWEL:  Colace/Senna PRN\n\n\n13.

An additional group of indeterminate microcalcifications was noted in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. \nOn 3/22/72 a biopsy of the left breast mass confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma. Stereotactic core biopsy of the upper outer quadrant calcifications showed only fibrocystic changes. On 5/31/72 she underwent a L lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy.  Pathology revealed a 2.0 x 2.5 x 2.3cm invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3,  with negative margins, ER+PR+Her2neu-, sentinel node negative.

It has remained stable compared to the last value of 7.10 on 10/29/2122. Hemoglobin A1c is a blood test that indicates how well you have controlled your blood sugar over the past 3 months. We would like to keep it below 7.\n\n\nI suggest a trial of metformin 500mg twice daily\ntest your sugars to keep below 140 2 hours after meals\n\nIf you have any questions about these results, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\nOlney Francis Ong, M.D., Ph.D.\n\n\n\n",

When pressed, she notes that about 6 months ago, she had an episode of mild chest tightness while at rest which was not particularly severe nor was it exacerbated or relieved by any measures.  These sx occurred only once, and lasted for a \"few hours\" before abating.  She reports that she thought it might be \"heartburn,\" though she is not prone to dyspepsia.  Subsequently, she denies any exertional dyspnea, CP, jaw or arm pain, belching, post-prandial discomfort, \"heartburn\" or palpitations.  She has not had any sx of CHF including pnd, orthopnea or LE edema.  Moreover, she denies claudication (legs or arms).  She reports that she has a \"sedentary\" lifestyle, but still carries groceries, does laundry, and usual housework without limitation.  She presented to her PCP Dr. Ong for an annual physical recently and on ECG, he noted new inferior Q waves and referred her for ETT which she had today.  As noted below, she had an early positive ECG with NO symptoms of angina, but with marked light-headedness with STD and bigeminy lasting up to 20' into recovery.  Scans were notable for EF 51% with inferior HK and an inferior fixed defect and inferolateral ischemia.  She was then transferred to BH ED and here to MMC for angiography.\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n   DM2 since 10/20 A1c 8.2 most recently on diet control\nDyslipidemia with low HDL and LDL 80s on Lipitor 10\nThyroid Nodule\nOral Ca (SCC) s/p resection and regional LN dissection 2120 at Dunn County Associates.

From a global perspective, she must have her coronary ischemia addressed with definitive assessment of her coronary anatomy given her high-risk ETT.  I have discussed the rationale, risks and benefits of diagnostic angiography, and she understands and is willing to proceed.  She understands that revascularization decisions will be dynamic and may include PCI or CABG (or medical rx).  She must also have aggressive secondary prevention measures instituted as well as a more deliberate assessment of her L SCA stenosis and steal syndrome, as this may in fact become overtly manifest should the L SCA stenosis worsen.\n\n1) CAD: ASA 325mg daily, Statins to LDL&lt;70mg/dL, Low dose BB for now along with ACEI to R arm BP of 140s/80s for now.  NPO after midnight with plans for coronary angiography (+/- LSCA angiogram) and possibly renal angiography given severe hypertension and systemic atherosclerosis.  Will discuss with Drs. Harper/Kumar tomorrow.  Suggest LHC (cross valve), Cors, L SCA angio/gradient, LVG.  She does not seem to have any obvious contra-indications to DES (bleeding diathesis, upcoming procedures, etc)\n2) L SCA stenosis with steal: Angiography will be the most expeditious way to evaluate the significance of this.  She denies arm claudication, but should she need the LIMA for CABG, the prox L SCA will need to be addressed.\n3) Secondary prevention as above\n4) DM: Will need medical rx on d/c.  Follow sugars while in house\n5) PAD: Consider ABIs to establish baseline after d/c.\n6) FULL CODE\n\n\t\nNathan O. Duncan, MD pager #26483\n\n\t\nSigned electronically by  Nathan O.

HUGHES, MD \n\n \nFOLLOW UP NOTE \n \nDIAGNOSIS:  Renal cell carcinoma, presumably metastatic to T1.  Interval since conformal radiation therapy to vertebra T1 to a dose of 50.4 gray:  Three months.  \n \nTUMOR STATUS:  Not available.  \n \nNORMAL TISSUE STATUS:  No difficulty.  \n \nINTERVAL HISTORY:  Mr. Lagnston is generally doing well with no deterioration and some improvement in his symptomatology.  He now has occasionally tingling in his feet and hands, which is possibly similar to before or less so.  He also has some posterior neck tingling, probably related to some position or activity and with lifting weight.  He has no weakness in any extremities.  His nocturia has decreased from three to one.  His hands feel a little \"fuzzy.\"  The trembles, which he has had for some time are possibly better or the same, still a little worse on the left hand than the right.  \n \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination he looks well.  His weight is up to 230 pounds.  He has no percussible bony tenderness throughout.  His abdomen is entirely negative, so is his incision.  \n \nIMPRESSION:  Clinically possibly slightly improved, certainly no evidence of progression.  \n \nPLAN:  I will obtain a repeat chest and thoracic spine CT, as well as a bone scan.  Assuming that these are not indicative of further progression, I plan to see him in routine follow up in four to six months.  Dr. Levine would like some blood tests drawn on him, which I will happy to arrange when I hear exactly what they are.  Dr. Sweet is still seeing him frequently and giving him Norvasc and Atenolol for his blood pressure.  \n \n_______________________________ \nGARY J.

At the time of this stenting, he had total occlusion of his midRCA and mid circumflex with collaterals.  He presented with recurrent CP in May, and he underwent a second cath that revealed patent LAD with stent.  This admission he had a 10-15 minute episode of chest and jaw pain with tachycardia and hypertension by home monitoring.  The pain resolved with two sublingual nitroglycerins.  He went to Butte Ridge Associates where he was placed on heparin.  In the setting of heparin bolus with PPT >150, he had one episode, moderate volume of painless rectal bleeding.  Since transfer, still on heparin, he had no further bleeding, nor guiac positive stool until today.   This morning he passed a large brown bowel movement which was guiac negative.  Following this, after returning to bed, he had a small amount of oozing of blood from his rectum.  He had no abdominal pain.  No further bleeding since this morning.  He has never had rectal bleeding previously on aspirin and plavix.  His colonoscopy in 2066 revealed diverticulosis.  He is currently on aspirin, plavix, heparin with therapeutic PTT.\n\n\n\nPMH:\n\nCAD\n\nHypertension\n\nHypercholesterolemia\n\nCRI\n\nBilateral RCC - s/p L nephrectomy,  R RFA, XRT.

This bleeding was minimal and self-limited, most likely of hemorrhoidal origin, rather than diverticular.  He does have some risk of recurrent rectal bleeding on these blood thinners, but the bleeding is likely to continue to be limited.  There is no contraindication to cardiac catherization or continuing these important medications.  There is also no intervention we could do now to adjust the risk.  Would recommend proceeding to cardiac catherization.  No alteration in medications required.  \n\n\n\nOpal Larson, M.D. \n\nGI Fellow - Page 09744\n\n      \n\n\n\n",

He has diffuse disease, otherwise with good collateralization.  His exercise tolerance test in May showed excellent exercise tolerance, but positive images and positive tracings for ischemia.  His Duke ETT score was -10, but his perfusion images showed moderate reversibility in the inferior myocardium with fixed defect anteriorly.  He had infero-apical hypokinesis with an EF of 45%.  It is also noted that his blood pressure fell, but normalized during exercise.  The patient has been stable until last several weeks when he has noted some lower jaw symptoms anteriorly.  He has no chest squeezing, neck squeezing, or jaw pain, but there is an odd sensation under the front teeth.  He correlates this with exercise, but not consistently.  He also occasionally feels this at rest.  He is able to walk uphill and generate a pulse of 90.  He is working doing heavy labor in the garden, moving, and digging.  It is not clear that this represents angina, but we will let Dr. Null know.  He is seeing Dr. Null in three to four weeks.     01/13/2072: .  The patient has been improving steadily since his last admission for CABG in November 2070.  He states his exercise tolerance is steadily improving and he is able to walk 2 miles at a rate of 17 minutes per mile without dyspnea or fatigue.  He has no chest pain or palpitations.  He does worry about bradycardia and states his metoprolol of 50 mg BID may be too much.  He has been withholding half to full dose in the evenings when he finds his pulses about 50.  He has no symptoms of forgetfulness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness.  He does have cold extremities.  There is no weight gain, weight loss, or orthopnea.  He remains on beta blocker, lipitor, Diovan, hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, and warfarin.  He is no longer on Plavix.  He has no nitrate.  On exam, he is somewhat hypertensive, but lungs are good and there is no elevated JVP.  His EKG shows first-degree AV block and I have asked him to bring that to Dr.  Null's office today.  \n\nA: Stable. \n\nP: Continue medicines as they are because of borderline blood pressure today.  We would not escalate\n\n\n\nElevated blood pressure\n\nThe patient is on Diovan, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol.  He states his blood pressure at home is usually quite good and he feels it is responsive to external stressors.  I have asked him to think hard about removing those stressors from his life in order to maintain health.\n\n\n\nHyperlipidemia\n\nThe patient remains on 40 mg of lipitor.  It has been a year since we have checked his excellent results and we will check today.  He has been fasting for 12 hours.\n\n\n\nIron deficiency anemia\n\nWe will recheck his indices today.  He is not fatigued or pale.\n\n\n\nRenal carcinoma\n\nThe patient had repeat MRI and CT in January at the Healthwin Hospital.  These were read as stable and he needs no intervention other than continued monitoring at six-month intervals.

This patient\nwith end stage renal disease secondary to diabetes was initiated\non hemodialysis 2 weeks ago in MH.  She has been doing well\nexcept for the complaint of fevers and rigors intermittently for\nthe past week.  There is no history of cough, dyspnea, or chest\npain.  She denies any dysuria, urgency, or frequency.  Her blood\nsugars at home have been between 120 and 180.  \n \nHer current medications include Tums 5 to 6 tabs with meals,\nErythropoietin, Premarin and Provera, Nephrox 150 mg tid, insulin\nNPH 10 units qam.\n \nOn July 17, after hemodialysis, Ms. Tinsley was given a partial\ndose of Vancomycin and developed pruritus.  CBC at the time\nrevealed a white count of 6.2 with a hematocrit of 25.2.  Blood\ncultures were sent.\n \nOn examination today this lady appeared well with a BP of 110/60\nand a pulse of 88.  She was afebrile.  Head and neck examination\nwas unremarkable and chest was clear to IPPA.  On cardiovascular\nexamination JVP was at the sternal angle and there was no\nperipheral edema.  Heart sounds were normal.\n \nUrinalysis did not reveal and white cells and contained 3+\nprotein and 2+ glucose.\n \nMiss Tinsley should be followed up at her dialysis center. \nThere does not appear to be any evidence of a graft infection. \nShe should also have a urine sent for culture to rule out urinary\ntract infection.  Because of her early satiety she has been\neating poorly and we might suggest that she be started on a\ngastroprokinetic agent such as Cisapride 10 mg qid.\nVincent Ventura, M.D.         -2-\nRE:  Peggy Tinsley\n     MR #236-67-03-3\n \n \nThank you for allowing us to be involved in the care of this\npatient.\n \nYours sincerely,\n \n \n \nMartin Y.

Her chief\nsymptomatic complaint is severe pruritus, which has not improved\nmuch with Benadryl.  She has yet to fill the prescription for Sarna\nlotion.  Her diarrhea has improved with Imodium, and she brought in\nsamples for cultures today.  Her appetite has improved somewhat.\nShe notes exertional fatigue and shortness of breath.  Medications\ninclude Phoslo 1 tablet t.i.d., Lasix 160 mg b.i.d., Altase  2.5 mg\nb.i.d., Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d., NPH 10 units q.d., iron t.i.d.\n \nOn examination, weight was 46.8 kilos, which is stable.  Heart rate\nwas 72, blood pressure 130/64.  JVP was clearly seen at 6 cm\ngreater than the sternal angle, and there was 1 plus peripheral\nedema.  There was no S3.  Chest examination revealed bibasilar\ninspiratory crackles.  Her left hand is no longer cold, but the\nPTFE graft remains slightly edematous.\n \nBlood work from May 30th showed a hematocrit of 23, potassium 5.2,\nbicarbonate 15, BUN 91, creatinine 7.9, calcium 5.5., phosphate\n5.2, albumin 3.4.\n \nWe will continue to hold off on dialysis until such time as Peggy's\nPTFE graft is suitable.  This will save her the additional\nmorbidity of a semipermanent IJ catheter.  She is more hypervolemic\nthan last week, and I added Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg in the morning to her\ndiuretic regimen.  By oversight, she was not started on Rocaltrol,\nand I have started her on Rocaltrol .25 mcg p.o. q.d., and\nNephrocaps 1 p.o. q.d.\n \nPage 2\nVincent Ventura, M.D.\nRe:  Peggy Tinsley\n     MR#  236-67-03-3\nJune 6, 2083\n \nA follow-up appointment was arranged in one week's time.\n \nYours sincerely,\n \n \n \nKeith Quant, M.D.\nRenal Fellow\n \n \n \nY.

Stafford, M.D.\nChief, Transplant Divistion\nDepartment of Surgery\nFamily Practice Missoula\n \n                                        Re:  Peggy Tinsley\n                                             FPM#:  236-67-03-3\n \n \nDear Dr. Stafford:\n \n     I was asked to provide a cardiologic evaluation on Mrs.\nTinsley with a concentration on her appropriateness to be listed\nas a recipient for a cadaver renal transplant.  In summary, she is\na 46 year old woman who has been an insulin dependent diabetic\nsince the age of 29 and has been on hemodialysis since 2083.  By\nreport, her other complications for diabetes include retinopathy,\nperipheral neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease.  In viewing\nher present history, she works in the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt learning technology department.  Her\nthree times a week hemodialyses are uncomplicated.  She does,\nhowever,  experience occasional chest pressure with activities and\non rare occasions has had nocturnal angina.  These episodes are\nrelieved by nitroglycerin.  Mrs. Tinsley has also noted that with\nwalking she will occasionally get short of breath which is relieved\nby slowing down.  \n \n     In addition to diabetes and hypertension which was present\nonly pre-dialysis, she has been and continues to be a smoker.  Her\ncholesterol by one report was 228 mg/dl.  I don't have\nfractionations and her family history is unknown.  \n \n     A report of an echocardiogram from April of 2083, shows mild\nventricular hypertrophy in the presence of mitral insufficiency,\npreserved LV size and function.  She had an exercise tolerance test\nin February of 2085.  On a modified protocol, she went for less\nthan 4 1/2 minutes.  This is equivalent to not even completing\nstage 1 of the standard Bruce.  With that, she did develop chest\npain and had 2 mm of ST depression. That study was accompanied by\nboth fixed and reversible isotopic perfusion changes in the septum\nconsistent with prior non-transmural infarct with exercise induced\nischemia.  As was apparent to those involved, even the non-isotope\nportion alone was worrisome for high grade coronary disease and led\nto the recommendation for a cardiac catheterization.  \n \n     That study was done in Macdonald Hospital and at this time, I\nonly have the report.  However, from this report, there was\npreserved LV function with anterior lateral hypokinesis and trace\nMR that is consistent with the echo and the thallium studies. \nCoronary angiography showed by report, diffuse involvement of\nproximal mid-LAD without specific focal stenosis until an 80% mid-\nLAD.  The circumflex was also diffusely diseased and there was a\ndiscrete stenosis in the mid section of a large marginal.  The\nright coronary artery was diffusely diseased with a discrete\nstenosis.  At that time, the recommendation was to continue medical\ntherapy.  \n \n     Her medical therapy at this time is estrogen replacement with\nprempro 2.5 mg once a day, tenormin 25 mg qd, aspirin one every\nother day in addition to her supplemental vitamins, iron and twice\ndaily insulin therapy.  \n \n     In rounding out her medical history, her surgical procedures\nhave involved the hemodialysis access.  She has had one pregnancy\n28 years ago without complications.  I also elicited a history of\nsome focal arm weakness and occasional slurring of speech.  This\nwas difficult to pin down, but is of some concern.\n \n     On exam, her blood pressure was 150/80  mm Hg, pulse 90\nregular, her weight 95 lbs.  Her hemodialysis shunt is on the left\narm.  There was a right carotid bruit, neck veins were not\ndistended.  Lungs were clear, PMI was displaced and sustained. \nThere was an S4, no S3 and there was a holo systolic murmur at the\napex.  Abdomen was benign, femoral pulses were intact, extremities\nwere without edema.  The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm,\ndiffuse STT changes.  There were no pathologic Q waves.\n \n     Although the focus of this evaluation was originally for\ntransplant candidacy, I am concerned about her current cardiac\nstatus.  She is a young diabetic woman, symptomatic of both\nshortness of breath and chest pain and on exercise test, has\nlimited functional capacity.  The coronary angiography reveals a\npresence of multi-vessel disease.  Even without seeing the primary\ndata which I hope to do in the next week, it would be unlikely that\nshe would be an angioplasty candidate, given the poor results in diabetics.  \nTherefore, coronary revascularization for her would be coronary artery \nbypass surgery. \n \n \n     Obviously, I would like to review the films first, and speak\nwith Dr. Upson regarding augmentation of her anti-anginals.  I\nwould also like to add pravastatin at this time, starting with only\n10 mg and obtain non-invasive studies of the carotids.  As\nindicated, although the focus of this evaluation was her\nsuitability for transplantation, the issue of controlling\nsymptomatic coronary artery disease in this young woman became more\npressing.\n \n     I look forward to working with you and the other physicians in\nher care.\n \n \n                                   Sincerely,\n \n \n \n                                   Quentin U. Johnson, M.D., Ph.D.\n \nQuentin U.

His note reflects our joint assessment and plan.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, Ms. Levin is a 54-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who has known coronary artery disease.  She had an exercise test in 2076 for some vague symptoms, which was positive, and led to cardiac catheterization.  This catheterization revealed 60% LAD lesion, 50% first marginal, 60% RCA, and a 70% diagonal lesion.  She was maintained on medical management with few symptoms.  She has been lost to followup from Cardiology Clinic.  She has within the last week developed increasing symptoms with minimal exertion.  She underwent a stress test in which she was able to exercise for 6 minutes and 9 seconds on the Bruce protocol.  She achieved 93% of age-predicted maximal heart rate.  At 4 minutes, she developed 2 mm ST segment depressions in the anterior leads associated with chest discomfort.  She is a vague historian, but has not had clear rest anginal symptoms.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, she is mildly obese white female.  She has no jugular venous distention.  Her carotids are 2+.  Her heart shows normal S1 and S2.  There is a 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex.  Lungs are clear.  Abdomen is benign.  Extremities show no cyanosis or edema.  Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm, normal axis and intervals.  There is no evidence of ischemia or infarction.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Ms. Levin is a 55-year-old diabetic woman with progressive anginal symptoms with known moderate 3-vessel coronary artery disease from 4 years ago with at least moderate risk, positive stress test.  After discussion with Dr. Camacho, our plan will be continue her on aspirin, beta-blocker, and a low-dose ACE inhibitor through her regimen.  She refuses to take a cholesterol-lowering agent due to previous concerns with myalgias.  She will be referred for cardiac catheterization within the next several days with a goal to better define her coronary anatomy for the possibility of percutaneous coronary intervention versus cardiac bypass surgery.\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nClyde Roe, MD\n\n\nDictated By: Clyde Roe\n\n\neScription document:1-3896405 AFFocus\n\n\n\nDD: 10/11/80\nDT: 10/12/80\nDV: 10/11/80\n\n\n\n",

His total time down is unclear, but the patient had an AED administered and he was shocked x2.  When EMTs arrived, they found the patient to be in VF w/ agonal breathing.  CPR was administered and he was shocked x3.  After the 3rd defibrillation, the patient awoke and was in NSR.  The patient could not recall any of the events.  \n\nAt DGH, was hemodynamically stable and did not have a recurrence of malignant arrhythmia.  His EKG showed TWI v3-v6.  His troponins went from 0.01-0.27-0.34, CK 451 w/ MB 28 (full laboratory values not available).  TTE showed depressed LV function w/ EF 30%, w/ apical apical dyskinesis.  Head CT was negative for acute process.  His mental status demonstrated slowly recovering delirium.  He was found to have a pneumonia and treated with ceftriaxone/azithromycin.  His arrhythmias were treated with amiodarone IV, transitioned to po.  He was transferred to NAMC for cardiac catheterization.  \n\nReview of Systems:\nUnavailable secondary to mental status.\n\nPast Medical/Surgical History:\nHypercholesterolemia\nHypertension\nSchizophrenia\nH/o abnormal SPEP\n\nTTE none in CAS\nSTRESS none in CAS\n\nAllergies:\nNKDA\n\nMedications at home:\nAspirin 81mg qd\nHCTZ 25mg qd\nLipitor 10mg qd\nB12 1000mcg qd\nZyprexa ?\n\nMedications on transfer:\nAmiodarone 400mg bid\nAspirin 81mg qd\nAzithromycin 250mg qd\nCeftriaxone 1000mg qd\nLovenox 50mg qd\nMetoprolol 50mg bid\nAtivan 1mg q4 prn\nPercocet q4 prn\n\nSocial History:\nLives alone\nTOB: quit 20y prior\nETOH: occasional\nILLICITS: unknown\n\nFamily History:\nM: unknown\nF: h/o MI\n\n\nPhysical Examination:\nGEN: \tsomnolent, easily arousable w/ manual stimulation, answers some questions, but not very interactive, breathing at 20, mildly labored\nVS: \nT\n98.2\nP\n55\nBP\n130/74\nRR\n20\nO2SAT\n96%2L\n\t\nHEENT: \tpinpoint pupils/equal, JVP at least 11cm\nPULM: \twheezes, moderate air movement\nCV: \tbradycardic, regular, S1 and S2 normal, no murmurs\nABD: \tsoft, NT/ND/NM/NHSM.

Pt converted to NSR in the field. He was stabilized at Blakely House, then transferred to NAMC. At NAMC, patient had electrocardiac cath, which showed 3vd disease and Dr. Albright   s team was consulted. As pt was encephalopathic s/p arrest, he was transferred to Fremont Medical Center on 02/21/33, where he was rehabilitated and his mental status improved. At FMC, his diuretics were titrated (lasix 20 mg -> 40 mg), and psychiatry weighed in on his posthypoxic encephalopathy.

Long, M.D.\nGlenn Helen Medical Group\nGlenn Helen Infirmary\nAlgoma, CO  71183\n \nRE:  Roberta Vincent\n     MR #380-18-32-2\n \nDear Dr. Long:\n \nThank you for referring Ms. Roberta Vincent to the Renal Services Clinic.  I had the pleasure of seeing her on November 16,\n2092.  Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.\n \nMs. Vincent is a 56-year-old mother of eight with chronic renal\nfailure of unknown etiology.  She is six years status post\nhysterectomy for endometriosis during which an occult\nleiomyosarcoma was discovered.  She has an extensive history of\nhidradenitis, obesity, and hypertension.  She had one stillborn\ninfant, one premature infant, and three spontaneous abortions. \nSFOC records are unavailable at this time.\n \nHer medications include Premarin 0.625 qd, Diltiazem 240 qd,\nfurosemide 40 mg qd, Mevacor 20 mg qd, Calcitriol 0.25 mcg qd,\nNiferex 300 mg qd, Vitamin E 400 units qd, fish oil qd, and Keflex\n250 mg qid.\n \nOn physical examination Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old woman in no\ndistress.  Her weight is 101.5 kilograms, or 223 lbs.  Temperature\nis normal.  Pulse is 88 beats per minute.  Blood pressure is\n178/96.  There is striking hirsutism and moon facies.  There is a\nbuffalo hump.  The lungs show scattered wheezing.  Cardiovascular\nexam is normal.  There are discolorations of the skin across the\nneck, upper extremities, and trunk which are hyperpigmented but not\nraised.  The abdomen is obese without palpable masses.  There is a\nventral hernia deep in the lower part of the abdomen.  The\nextremities show trace edema.  There are several areas of\nsuperficial petechiae.\n \nIn summary, this 56-year-old woman has chronic renal failure of\nunclear etiology.  She does report an episode of lower extremity\nswelling in association with an episode of hidradenitis.  ThisRoberta Vincent\nMR #380-18-32-2               -2-            November 16, 2092\n \n \nraises the possibility of a post-infectious glomerulonephritis now\nin a chronic phase.  Other diagnostic possibilities include other\nforms of chronic glomerulonephritis including systemic lupus\nerythematosus given the history of spontaneous abortions. \nNevertheless, I agree that kidney biopsy is not indicated at this\ntime given the advanced nature of her disease and the increased\nrisk due to her body habitus.\n \nI discussed several options in renal replacement therapy with Ms.\nVincent. Although she has no medical conditions which would\npreclude living-related or cadaveric kidney transplantation, her\nobesity and glucose intolerance along with the history of\nhidradenitis make transplantation a less attractive option.  I have\nencouraged Ms. Vincent to attempt a gradual weight loss program in\norder to improve her fitness prior to either dialysis or\ntransplantation.  Nevertheless, her appearance is quite reminiscent\nof Cushing's disease, and this should be worked up if it has not\nbeen performed previously.\n \nI have arranged an iothalamate GFR to more closely approximate her\nkidney function and a follow-up appointment in two months' time to\nmeet with Helen Uren and consider creation of a native AV\nfistula or placement of a graft.\n \nThank you once again for your kind referral.\n \nRespectfully,\n \n \n \nElias Q. Mercado, M.D.\n \n \n \nS. Quenton Jolley, M.D.\nGlenn Helen Medical Group\n80 Whitney St\nAlgoma, CO  71183\n \nDD: 11/16/92\nDT: 11/24/92\nDV: 11/16/92\n \n/joshi\n \ncc:  Edward Xanthos, M.D.\n     Saint Francis Outpatient Center\n     784 Greatstone Drive\n     Boulder, CO  72529\n\n\n\n\n",

We will\nnot repeat her history as you know it well. Over the past three\nmonths Mrs. Vincent has complained of increasing fatigue,\noccasionally sleeping more than 12 hours per night, forgetfulness\nand tingling of the fingers and toes. She has maintained a\nrelatively good appetite and denies nausea, vomiting or shortness\nof breath.  An Iothalamate GFR test obtained on December 14, 2092\nrevealed a glomerular infiltration rate of approximately 10 ml per\nminute, suggesting profound loss of renal function.\n \nOn physical examination today her weight is 99.5 kilograms or 219\npounds.  Blood pressure is 150/90, pulse is 80 and regular.  The\nlungs are clear. There is no peripheral edema. Again, there marked\ncushingoid features. Despite overall weight loss, Mrs. Vincent\ncomments that she has gained facial and abdominal fat as well as\nfacial hair over the past several months.\n \nIn summary, Mrs. Vincent appears to be developing early symptoms of\nuremia.  Given her advanced azotemia we believe that she should\nundergo creation of an arteriovenous fistula so that she may start\ndialysis within the next several months. We have arranged to\nrecheck her chemistries today.  We would also recommend that she\nundergo repeat work up for her cushingoid features.  Although renal\nfailure may alter hormonal balance and may promote occasional\nandrogenic features in woman, this is beyond ordinary.\n \nThank you once again for allowing us to participate in her care.  \n \nEdward Xanthos, M.D.\nRE:  Roberta Vincent\nMR #380-18-32-2\nJanuary 18, 2093\nPage #2\n \n \nPlease do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of any further\nassistance.\n \nSincerely,\n \n \n \n \nElias Q. Mercado, M.D.\n \n \n \nS. Quenton Jolley, M.D.\n \nDD: 01/18/93\nDT: 01/24/93\nDV: 01/18/93\n/knox\n\n\n\n\n",

Pupils \nwere reactive normally bilaterally.  Oropharynx was clear.  Neck \nwas mildly obese with no jugular venous distention.  There were \ngood carotid upstrokes, no bruit.  Lungs had some crackles \ntwo-thirds of the way up and some rales at the bases, one-half way \nup.  Cardiac examination revealed S1 and S2, somewhat tachycardic, \nwith a 2/6 murmur.  Abdomen had multiple striae and was soft and \nnon-tender, with good bowel sounds.  There were good pulses \nthroughout.  Extremities were normal. \nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  Electrolytes here were normal.  Blood sugar \nwas normal.  White count was 14, hematocrit 34.  Initial CK was \n140, troponin 2.6.  Chest x-ray showed moderate effusion and a \nsmall left effusion.  Patient's last echocardiogram showed an \nejection fraction of 60 percent.  This echocardiogram was done in \nFebruary of 2096.  She also had a second echocardiogram in April of \n2096 which showed an ejection fraction of 55 percent, with moderate \nMR.  EKG here showed ST depression in V6 and some decreased T's in \naVR and aVL.  Sinus rhythm on EKG rated about 100. \nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  In the Emergency Department the \npatient was heparinized.  She was placed on oxygen, given an \naspirin, and placed on a Nitroglycerin drip.  She also received \nsome Nitropaste here.  She also received a mg of Morphine.  SFOC \nCardiology was aware of the patient's troponin of 2.6, indicating \nthat she had a myocardial infarction or could still be evolving a \nmyocardial infarction here.  She received IV Lasix 60 mg here and \nresponded very well.  She was diuresing considerably and her \nshortness of breath appeared to be much better than when she \narrived here in the Emergency Department. \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure with myocardial \ninfarction, diuresing well and responding to medications. \nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was \nadmitted to the CCU.  SFOC is aware.  She remains in stable \ncondition here and is going to be transferred up to CCU in a little \nwhile.  Condition at this time is satisfactory. \n___________________________________                    PF091/9353 \nDEXTER N.

Also \nwith a history of borderline hypertension previously on \nhydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. q.d. for the last year, which he discontinued \nlast Sunday, who now comes in because over the last two to three weeks \nhe has been having trouble with increased dizziness and headaches, and \nhe is afraid that his sugar is up.  He states that over the last two or \nthree weeks, he gets stars and floaters and sometimes halos of light \nfollowed by mild headaches.  He says that the visual changes are usually \naccompanied by the headache, and the headache is usually relieved with \nExcedrin in 5 minutes to an hour.  He does admit to a history of \nmigraines but states that in the past his migraines have been much more \nsevere than this, though the visual aura is very similar to his previous \nmigraine aura.  \n \nHe states that he was seen in the emergency room on 1-12, at which time \nthey did a finger stick which was about 180, and they told him to come \nto this appointment at this time.  He denies any fevers.  He does have a \nrecent 25 lb weight gain and he admits to new nocturia of 2-3 times a \nnight over the last three weeks.  He also has been complaining of \ndiarrhea two or three times a week over the last two to three weeks, \nwhich is watery in nature without any blood.  He has no nausea or \nvomiting or any fever, and he has never had problems with diarrhea like \nthis in the past.  His past medical history is otherwise benign.  \n \nHabits:  He does have a history of cocaine abuse, and while he was free \nbasing about one year ago, he came into the emergency room with chest \npain and was told that this was secondary to lack of oxygen to his heart \nfrom the cocaine, since which time he has been using cocaine much less \nfrequently.  He denies any tobacco use, and he drinks alcohol socially.  \nHe is currently unemployed and lives with his mother.  He is sexually \nactive with one sexual partner and denies any other risk factors.\n \nFamily History:  His family history is notable for a grandmother with \ndiabetes and hypertension, mother with heart disease and father with \nhistory of breast CA, who is currently getting radiation therapy here.  \nHis oldest brother died of street violence and his younger brother is \nalive and well without any medical problems. \n \nPhysical Examination;  He is a mildly obese black male in no acute \ndistress with weight of 270 lbs.  Blood pressure 138/88 in the right arm \nand 132/94 in the left arm.  Pulse regular at about 80.  HEENT was \nnotable for normal fundi without any evidence of diabetic retinopathy or \nhypertensive retinopathy.  Oropharynx was clear.  He had no thyromegaly.  \nHis chest was clear.  His breasts showed no masses or discharge, and his \n                                              1-29-62\n \n \n \nheart sounds were normal.  His abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, \nwithout any hepatosplenomegaly.  Genitalia: normal, with bilaterally \ndescended testes, and his rectal exam was normal tone with brown trace \nheme positive stool.  Neurologic exam was intact. \n \nAssessment and Plan:  \n \n1.   Non-insulin dependent diabetes with possible symptoms of increased \n     sugar at this time.  Will check a fasting blood sugar tomorrow \n     morning as well as a hemoglobin A1C, and may increase his Diabeta \n     to 10 mg. q.d.  He will be referred to a nutritionist for diet \n     control as well.  \n2.   Hypertension: borderline hypertension at this time off meds.  I \n     will recheck his blood pressure in a week to two weeks, and if it \n     is still borderline at that time, will follow only with a low-salt \n     diet.  \n3.   Trace heme positive stool: may be from his diarrhea.  I will get a \n     stool culture and O&P since the diarrhea is persistent for two to \n     three weeks, and follow it at this time.\n4.   Patient requesting HIV test: and HIV counseling was given at this \n     point, and a test will be drawn, and I will give him the result \n     when it is back, though I feel that he is very low risk at this \n     time.  \n \n \n_________________________\nCadence Barton, M.D. \n \nFL:RP:2786\nDD:1-29-62\nDT:1-30-62\nDV:1-29-62\n\n\n\n\n",

The patient's current medical \nproblems include:\n1.   Recent DVT.  The patient was admitted between the days of 1-24 and \n     1-30 secondary to the development of a right lower extremity DVT.  \n     The patient told me that he had been doing well and denied any \n     previous trauma to his leg or other predisposing factors such as long \n     car or airplane trips and he stated he had been as active as \n     previously over the recent few weeks.  The patient stated he awoke \n     in the morning of the 24th and noted tightness in his right \n     quadriceps and right calf.  He later developed progressive swelling \n     of the leg and therefore presented to the THD emergency \n     department.  He had lower extremity non-invasives performed which \n     confirmed the presence of a right lower extremity DVT.  He was \n     admitted and heparinized and then Coumadinized prior to discharge.  \n     The patient disclosed a history that his daughter had a DVT at the \n     time of her pregnancy and therefore a hypercoagulability work-up was \n     sent off which was negative.  The patient currently returns to me \n     complaining of further right calf pain and swelling.  He states that \n     he was interested in physical therapy but states that that did not \n     occur during his hospital course.  The patient was also angry and \n     upset that I had not visited him during his hospital stay.  I \n     explained to him that I had not been notified of his admission or of \n     his emergency department visit.  I called all of the parties \n     responsible for his admission to clear the confusion that had \n     occurred.\n \n2.   Hypertension.  The patient's previously been on anti-hypertensives \n     including lisinopril, unfortunately the patient has not tolerated ACE \n     inhibitors secondary to a severe cough and therefore these were \n     discontinued recently.  With a discontinuation of his drinking, the \n     patient's blood pressures have been under much better control.\n \n3.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.  I recently started the patient on \n     insulin.  He was scheduled for a follow up visit but unfortunately \n     did not make his visit.  His insulin dose was adjusted during his \n     recent hospitalization and his current dosage is 35 units of NPH in \n     the morning and 15 units of regular.  In the evening he takes 10 \n     units of NPH and 10 units of regular.  The patient does not yet have \n     a home glucometer.  We will arrange for this.\n \nTHD INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Hart, Matthew\nPage 2                                        46103196\n                                              2-4-65\n \n \n \nPhysical Examination:  Vital signs showed a heart rate of 90.  Blood \npressure: 135/92. Respiratory rate: 14 and unlabored.  HEENT: pupils \nequal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, \noropharynx clear. Mucous membranes moist. Cardiac: regular rate and \nrhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lungs: clear to \nausculation. Abdomen soft, nontender with active bowel sounds.  \nExtremities:  There was notable edema of his right lower extremity with \nsignificant pain and a positive Homan's sign.  \n \nImpression:\n1)   DVT.  Given his current physical examination, and lack of recent PT \n     check since time of discharge on the 30th, I am sending a stat PT.  I \n     encouraged the patient to elevate the leg. My feeling is that the DVT \n     has not successfully been treated and that likely his PT is not \n     therapeutic at the present time.  I have arranged for the patient to \n     follow up with Aguilar, the Internal Medicine nurse, on Wednesday for a repeat \n     check of his PT.  I left instructions that I should be called \n     immediately upon receiving the PT value, I also arranged for the \n     patient to meet with the physical therapist for the provision of a \n     cane to help with ambulation. \n \n2)   Adult onset diabetes.  I will recheck a hemoglobin A1C value at his \n     next office visit.  A finger stick in the office approximately three \n     hours after eating is 253.  I feel this is still too elevated.  I \n     will therefore adjust his insulin dose when I see him next week.  I \n     will follow up with the patient next week and make any necessary \n     adjustments in his medications at that time.\n \n \n \n_________________________\nMichael Uecker, M.D. \n \nPD:UD:1698\nDD:2-19-65\nDT:2-22-65\nDV:2-4-65\n\n\n\n\n",

Adult onset diabetes mellitus.  The patient had a hemoglobin A1C \n     approximately a month and a half ago, which was 9.5.  We discussed \n     this in the office today, with the general concept that someone who \n     is taking three injections of insulin a day should have much \n     tighter control.  He states he has been following his finger \n     sticks, though admits that occasionally forgets to do this. His \n     current regimen is 35 units of NPH in the morning with 20 units of \n     regular.  At bedtime, he is taking 35 units of NPH and 6 units of \n     regular at dinnertime.  He denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.\n2.   Hypercholesterolemia.  Of note, the patient recently experienced a \n     rash to his simvastatin.  This resolved on the discontinuation of \n     the simvastatin.  Of note, his most recent cholesterol was 314 in \n     January, 2067.  He has met with the dietician to discuss the \n     institution of a low-fat diet, and states that he tries to avoid \n     fats.\n3.   Venous insufficiency secondary to deep venous thrombosis.  The \n     patient states he is doing better since the institution of a \n     Jobst stocking.  He still notes significant edema when he doesn't \n     wear this, but notes an improvement in ambulation when he is \n     compliant with the stocking.\n \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure:  130/90.  Heart rate:  76.  \nRespiratory rate:  12 and unlabored.  Cardiac exam:  Regular rate and \nrhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs.  Lungs are clear to auscultation.  \nAbdomen:  Soft, non-tender, obese, with active bowel sounds.  \nExtremities show no clubbing or cyanosis.  There is 1+ pedal edema of \nthe right lower extremity, which is covered with a Jobst stocking.  Foot \ncare remains excellent.\n \nIMPRESSION:                         \n1.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.  We will increase the patient's \n     morning NPH dose to 40 units.  He will once again try to become \n     more compliant with his diet.  He will be scheduled for a follow up \n     ophthalmologic examination.\n2.   Hypercholesterolemia.  We will hold off re-starting therapy given \n     his recent rash to simvastin.  We will re-check a fasting lipid \n     profile as well as a set of LFT's.\nTRIBAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT\nTribal Internal Medicine Associates\n01 Cambridge St                             Hart, Matthew\nLonaconing, CT  91197                             46103196\n829-1293                                      3-09-67\n \n \n \nPAGE 2\n \n3.   General health maintenance.  We will once again schedule a follow \n     up examination with the dietician as well as the ophthalmologist.  \n     He will keep a log of his sugars and follow up with me in the \n     clinic in approximately one to two months.\n \n \n \n_________________________\nMichael Uecker, M.D.\n \nGG:XO:4403\nDD:3-27-67\nDT:3-27-67\nDV:3-09-67\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPreceptor HINES,ALEXANDER SAMMY,M.D. Note:\nPt seen with Dr. Uecker.

For his pre-operative work-up, the patient had a stress PET exam on 3/26 that was notable for a medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior and inferolateral walls that was reversible. As a result, the patient was referred to Dr. Carroll who saw the patient in clinic on 3/27. Given the patient's risk factors and positive stress test, the patient was scheduled for right and left heart catheterization on the day of admission with the plan to delay his hip surgery if he requires a stent and subsequent Plavix therapy. On the evening prior to his catheterization, he had dialysis.\n \nThe patient went to the cath lab where he was found to have an 80% lesion of the mid-RCA so a bare-metal stent was placed. After cath, the patient was started on ASA 325mg PO daily and Plavix loaded with 600mg PO x 1 then 75mg PO daily thereafter.

He said that his father has been\n\nsick, so he has been spending a significant amount of time\n\nhelping him and because of that had a short dialysis on Wednesday\n\nand missed his Friday dialysis run.  Today is Sunday and he\n\ngenerally gets dialysis on Sunday as well.  When I asked if he\n\nhas been having chest pain, he says he has not had chest pain,\n\nbut he did have a tickling in his chest that lasted seconds and\n\nwas not accompanying with any diaphoresis or radiation of the\n\npain.  Even he was ambulatory into the ED, he had no chest pain\n\nwhen he was exerting himself.  He does feel slightly increased\n\nshortness of breath and worse when he walks around, but he thinks\n\nthat because of increased fluids.  He has had no fevers or\n\nchills, no lightheadedness, no nausea, vomiting and no diarrhea.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,\n\ncoronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis,\n\ndiabetes, DVT on Coumadin, hypertension, bladder cancer,\n\nsubstance abuse and GERD.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  AV fistula in 01/2078.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, rare alcohol and occasional cocaine\n\nuse.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Breast cancer and prostate cancer.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As mentioned in HPI, otherwise negative.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Reviewed, please see the list.\n\nALLERGIES:  Include cephalosporin and simvastatin.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.3, heart rate 92,\n\nrespiratory rate 28, blood pressure 155/84 and O2 saturation 100%\n\non room air.  The patient is awake, alert, talking in complete\n\nsentences, appears to be mildly uncomfortable.  ENT:  Atraumatic.\n\n Neck:  Normal to inspection, supple.  Chest:  Clear to\n\nauscultation bilaterally, no rales.  Cardiovascular:  Regular\n\nrate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Minimal\n\ndistention, soft.  No focal tenderness.  Skin is intact. \n\nExtremities:  No lower extremity swelling or edema, no calf\n\ntenderness bilaterally.  Neuropsychiatric:  Oriented x3.  Cranial\n\nnerves II through XII tested and intact.  No motor or sensory\n\ndeficits.  Gait is normal.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient received an EKG, which\n\nshowed normal sinus rhythm.  No significant ST or T\n\nabnormalities, no significant peaked T waves are consistent with\n\nhis previous EKG.  PA lateral chest x-ray showed no evidence of\n\nacute cardiopulmonary infiltrates.  Only labs which resulted\n\ninitially were CBC, which showed a hematocrit of 33.2, platelets\n\n423,000 and white count of 6.74.  We made contact with the renal\n\nfellow who recommended that we proceed dialysis while the\n\ndialysis unit still open and we felt that it was safe for this\n\npatient.  His potassium was not back at the time that he left the\n\ndepartment, however, he was well appearing and had no arrhythmias\n\non the monitor and we think that his tickling chest sensation is\n\nvery atypical for cardiac symptom, not being, so we will reassess\n\nwhen he comes back and likely check a second troponin to be sure\n\nthat this is unlikely to be acute coronary syndrome.  After he\n\nleft the department, additional labs came back include INR of 2.1\n\nand a Chem-7 showing a sodium of 142, a potassium of 6.4, a\n\nchloride of 102, bicarbonate of 21, BUN of 106, creatinine 6.18,\n\nglucose of 195, CK of 157, troponin of less than 0.04, calcium\n\n8.6, phosphorus of 5.1, and magnesium of 2.3 and promptly called\n\nthe renal fellow who was aware of the elevated potassium and have\n\nthe patient on the monitor in the Dialysis Unit and agreed to\n\ntreat him there acutely.  Again after the dialysis, the patient\n\nwill return to the Emergency Department.  We will reassess if\n\nsymptoms and see how he feels, check a second cardiac enzymes. \n\nIf he feels significantly improved and he continues to have no\n\nchest pain, we feel that his symptoms are likely atypical for\n\nacute coronary syndrome and we also called that this was not\n\nacute coronary syndrome if two troponins are not elevated and he\n\nwill be able to follow up and resume his regular dialysis\n\nschedule.\n\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Volume overload.\n\nSECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis.\n\nDISPOSITION:  Pending.\n\nPlease see ED note for further ED course.  This was a shared\n\nvisit with resident physician, Dr. Adam Mcclure.\n\n______________________________\n\nNAPOLITANO, URSULA M.D.\n\nD: 06/14/79\n\nT: 06/14/79\n\nDictated By: NAPOLITANO, URSULA\n\neScription document:4-65347834 BFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Briefly, this patient has history of back pain, L buttock and leg pain for which he has been scheduled for an outpt open MRI next week. The pain was worse in the last few days such that he has had difficulty walking due to pain. He does not have any weakness or numbness no loss of control of bowel or bladder. No fevers/chills.

Pt reports that after having received pain medication he is now able to walk, whereas he wasn't earlier this evening when he first arrived because he was in too much pain.\n\nMedical Decision Making ED Course\n\n75M w/acute on chronic low back and left buttock pain, now improved after pain medication in the ED. The patient has no neurologic deficits at this time and is able to walk without assistance. Given the patient's history of prostate CA, he certainly needs further radiographic evaluation of his spine to evaluate for mets and should undergo MRI to assess for disc disease as well. Pt was offered MRI today, however he is certain he cannot tolerate a traditional closed MRI (he has tried before with medications). Given that the patient does not have any neurologic deficits, it is safe for him to be discharged home on an improved pain regimen with stool softeners as well and f/u with his already scheduled outpt open MRI next week. Pt and family understand to return if pt develops any neurologic symptoms.\n\nCondition on Discharge\n\nStable\n\nDiagnoses\n\nBack pain\n\nReview Comments\n\nI have personally seen and examined the patient and confirmed the resident's examination, reviewed and agree with the resident's documentation of history, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care and disposition of the patient with the resident.\n\n\n\nThis note has been electronically signed by TERESA  LAMB, MD 9/13/2150 7:30:19 PM\n\n\n\nClinical staff documenting in the ED note include:\n\n\n\nAttending/Nurse Practitioners(s)\n\n\n\nTERESA  LAMB, MD\n\nBRIANNA  WILKES, NP\n\nVETRA  MOON, NP\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\nRecord date: 2151-01-25\n\n January 25, 2151 (initial office note) Frank Caldwell:\n\tHe is a 75 year old man who is referred by Dr. Freda Erickson of Mauston for consultation regarding a biopsy proven adenocarcinoma in the head of the pancreas. He apparently developed some twinge type pain in his right upper quadrant which he describes as    zingers    6 or 7 weeks ago. Work-up then involved imaging with a CT scan which I reviewed but do not have the written report on. This shows a mass in the head of the pancreas abutting and perhaps distorting the portal vein. He has not had any jaundice and does not have any change in his bowel functions. A subsequent endoscopic ultrasound examination confirms the mass in the head of the pancreas with features of portal vein invasion. Fine needle aspiration has confirmed adenocarcinoma. The mass itself is about 2   cm in diameter.\n\tHis family history does not include any pancreatic cancer but his father had lung cancer.\n\tHe denies smoking, drinking but exercises by walking about 5 days a week.\n\tHis past surgical history includes a resection of an aortic aneurysm in 2131, cholecystectomy in 2131, prostatectomy for cancer in 2142 and resection of a lung cancer in 2143.\n\tHis current medications include Lipitor 40mg a day, Glyburide 5mg three times a day (he has been taking it for 6     7 years), Lisinopril 5mg a day and a baby aspirin.\n\tHe is said to be allergic to Sudafed and the dye used for CAT scans (the latter was apparently salivary gland swelling on the day following a CAT scan - - it is unclear whether the two are related).\n\tHis review of systems also includes kidneys stones and spinal stenosis. He has had some mild recent weight loss. He denies symptoms of heart disease, neurologic disease or respiratory disease. His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.\n\tI think he is not a candidate for attempted surgical resection at this time. With the findings consistent with portal vein invasion, he should first be treated with chemoradiation. He may be a candidate for subsequent surgery, probably not resection but perhaps intra-operative radiation therapy. I   ve explained this to him, his wife and daughter. After discussing the various alternatives we have agreed to have him evaluated in the Sawtooth Cancer Clinic for treatment planning for chemoradiation, with consideration of subsequent IORT. He comes from Elk Ridge and probably would prefer to have his treatment carried out at the Elk Ridge Health Center in coordination with us. This seems quite reasonable and we will proceed to set that up. I will also get a CA19-9 today and plan to see him at the completion of his chemoradiation.\n\tI spent 45 minutes in consultation and coordination of care.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBenjaman Y. Macias, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n",

The patient presents complaining of lower back pain with right lower extremity radiation. He develop symptoms gradually three months ago with no history of preceding trauma. The symptoms became progressively worse. The patient has a history of lower back injury 30 years ago in a motor vehicle accident - at that time he was diagnosed with disc rupture. Currently the pain is intermittent and occurs daily. He grades the intensity of the pain as up to 7 to 8 out of 10 on the numerical pain scale. He describes it as sharp shooting sensation in the lower back with radiation all the way down right lower extremity to the foot. The symptoms are worse with standing; better with sitting and lying down. There is no change in the intensity of symptoms with coughing or sneezing. The patient any recent fever or chills, no loss of bowel or bladder control. He describes occasional intermittent numbness in the right leg and foot. He denies any weakness. He lost 30 pounds through dieting over the past two months. The pain does not wake the patient up at night. \nDiagnostically, the patient denies any recent imaging studies of the lumbar spine. \n\n\nTherapeutically, the patient denies any recent physical therapy; no previous injections or surgical procedures of the lumbar spine. Currently he takes nabumetone 750 mg once in the morning with moderate relief of his symptoms. He also occasionally takes Naproxen at night with moderate relief. \nMEDICATIONS: \n1. Aspirin. \n2. Hydrochlorothiazide. \n3. Toprol. \n4. Caduet. \n5. Nabumetone as needed. \n6. Naproxen as needed. \nALLERGIES: Penicillin. \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: \n1. Coronary artery disease status post 2 stent placements. \n2. Hypertension. \nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: \n1. Cardiac stent placement. \n2. Left total hip replacement. \nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient works as a programmer for Dish Network. He is married with no children. He does not smoke, drinks alcohol socially, and denies illicit drug use. \nFAMILY HISTORY: There is no history of medical problems that run in the family. \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The complete review of systems was performed including constitutional, eyes, ENT, cardiovascular, respiratory, GI, GU, musculoskeletal, integument, neurological, psychiatric, endocrine, lymphatic, and immunologic. It is positive for musculoskeletal complains and medical problems as above.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is well-developed, moderately overweight man in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented to time, person and place. His mood and affect are stable. He demonstrates good attention and concentration. The patient ambulates without an assistive device with normal heel strike and toe off.  He is able to stand on his heels and toes. He is able to walk heel to toe in a straight line with intact balance. Vital signs are stable. Sclera is anicteric, no ptosis noted, no lymphadenopathy, unlabored respiration, abdomen is soft and non-tender, no skin rash.  \n\n\nThere is limited range of motion in the lumbar spine with flexion limited to 60 degrees, extension limited to 10 degrees. There is no tenderness to palpation over the spinous processes, paraspinal muscles, SI joints or greater trochanteric bursae bilaterally. There is full 5/5 strength in the lower extremities with intact sensation bilaterally.  1+ reflexes in the knees, absent reflexes in the ankles bilaterally. There is downgoing Babinski, no clonus, normal tone in the lower extremities. Straight leg raise test is negative bilaterally. There is no pain with hip internal and external rotation. \n\n\n\nCervical range of motion is within normal limit. There is no tenderness to palpation over cervical spinous processes and paraspinal muscles. There is full 5/5 strength in the upper extremities with intact sensation bilaterally. Symmetrical reflexes in the biceps, brachioradialis and triceps bilaterally. Negative Hoffmans sign and Spurlings maneuver.  The range of motion in bilateral upper extremities is normal. \nIMAGING: During today's visit I reviewed x-ray study of the pelvis dated September 24 2132. it demonstrates lumbosacral spondylosis in the visualized lumbosacral spine. \nFor complete description of the study, please see formal radiology report. \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Sub-acute lower back pain with right lower extremity radiation, non-focal neurological examination. \n2. Lumbar radiculitis. \n3. Degenerative disc disease. \n4. Lumbar spondylosis. \nRECOMMENDATIONS: \n1. MRI study of the lumbar spine will be obtained to further evaluate etiology of ongoing symptoms. The patient will discuss with radiologist if MRI study can not be performed due to cardiac stents. \n2. Upon review of the imaging studies, a lumbar epidural steroid injection would be considered to decrease the inflammatory component of his symptoms and to inhibit peripheral nociceptive transmission. \n3. The patient was encouraged to remain active and to participate in low-impact aerobic exercises to prevent deconditioning. He was encouraged to continue with weight loss program. \n4. The therapeutic plan was discussed with the patient. All of his questions were answered. He will be seen in follow-up after imaging study is completed in 1-2 weeks. \n\n\n\nThank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient. Please do not hesitate to call my office for any further questions. \n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________\nUbaldo R.

He underwent right piriformis injection under fluoroscopic guidance on 06/10/2133. The patient reports greater than 50% improvement in his symptoms after the procedure. Currently the pain is intermittent. He describes it as sore sensation in the right buttock. He grades intensity of pain as 2/10 on the numerical pain scale. The symptoms are worse with prolonged walking for more than 2 miles a day and completely alleviated with rest. There is no change in the intensity of symptoms with Valsalva maneuver. The patient denies any recent fever or chills, no loss of bowel or bladder control, no numbness, no weakness, no unexplained weight loss. \n\n\n\n\n\nREVIEW OF MEDICAL HISTORY: During today's visit, I have reviewed past medical, social and family history, medication list and allergies. There has been no interval change as compared to the previous visit. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for musculoskeletal complains as described above. No recent fever, no chills, no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no abdominal pain, no loss of bowel or bladder control, no unexplained weight loss. The rest of the systems were reviewed and are negative.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: The patient is alert and oriented to time, person and place. His mood and affect are stable. He demonstrates good attention and concentration. He ambulates without an assistive device with normal heel strike and toe-off. He is able to stand on heels and toes. He is able to walk heel-to-toe in a straight line with intact balance. There is limited range of motion in the lumbar spine with flexion limited to 80 degrees, extension limited to 20 degrees. There is no tenderness to palpation over piriformis muscles, paraspinal muscles, spinous processes, SI joints, or greater trochanteric bursa bilaterally. There is full 5/5 strength in the lower extremities with intact sensation bilaterally. 1+ reflexes in the knees, absent reflexes in the ankles bilaterally. There is downgoing Babinski, no clonus, normal tone in the lower extremities. Straight leg raise and femoral stretch test are negative bilaterally. There is pain with right hip internal rotation. \n\n\n\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1.  Piriformis syndrome.\n\n2.  Lumbar spondylosis with degenerative disk disease.\n\n3.  Right hip arthropathy.\n\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1.  I had lengthy discussion with the patient about his condition and further treatment options. The patient will continue with home exercise program that he learned in physical therapy.\n\n2.  The patient was encouraged to remain active and to participate in low-impact aerobic exercises as along as it does not exacerbate his symptoms.\n\n3.  The patient was counseled on the benefits of weight reduction. He was informed about Weight Center here at Brooksville Regional Hospital. He is trying to control his weight through a balanced diet and aerobic exercises. He will consider an evaluation at the Weight Center if those approaches are not successful.\n\n4.  The therapeutic plan was discussed with the patient. All of his questions were answered. In fact greater than 50% of today&#8217;s 25 minute visit was spent on counseling and coordination of care. I asked the patient to follow-up with me as needed if his symptoms return. \n\n\n\n\nIt was my pleasure to follow-up with him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n___________________________\n\nUbaldo Daugherty, MD\n.\n\n\n\n\ncc:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTD: 06/25/2133 09:13:37\n\nTR: 7765393\n\nBackJob ID:  780753\n\nVoiceJob ID:  06100547\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Patient says he was diagnosed \nas having neuropsychiatric lupus in 2103 at the Vermilion Hospital by Dr. Parker \nXian and was treated with steroids at the time. It's not clear what CNS \nor neuropsychiatric manifestation he had at the time. Because of complex \npartial seizures he was seen by Dr. Arce at the Livingstone Homes who \nreferred him to Dr. Hoffman at the Livingstone Homes who said that his \nestradiol level was in the 80s. His testosterone was up but available \ntestosterone was down so he was put on Clomid and testolactone which he \nsaid turned off the lupus and turned off his seizures. Said he was doing \nfine until around 2 weeks ago when he felt that his lupus recurred. He \nsaid his neck felt full and warm. His head felt like it was going to \nexplode. He had tinnitus, excess saliva, he felt that his lower jaw was \nvibrating and when he lay on his pillow his neck felt like it wasn't \nright. Also about the time he developed a cold with runny nose and \npostnasal drip. Lab work on February 8 showed a normal CBC, urine, and \nanti-DNA (in 2103 his ANA was positive at 1:1024 but I don't have any \nother results). He's had no fevers, no rashes other than a folliculitis \non his legs. No new problem with head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, teeth \nor gum except that he has to wear his glasses. Recently had some teeth \nremoved. Has a postnasal drip with a little bit of a cough. No other \ncardiorespiratory problems but takes Altace for mild hypertension. No GI \nproblems. Has urinary frequency due to nocturia ever 2 hours, due to \nbenign prostatic hypertrophy and recently had a TUR. Dr. Nunes \nRE:  Craft, Lloyd                             \nMRN: 26649180                        \nFebruary 17, 2114\nPage 2\n \n \nA PSA has been normal. Past history of kidney stones. He's allergic to \npenicillin, Lozol, allopurinol and bee venom. Has a past history of \ndiagnosis of gout versus pseudogout. Sleeps fine. No history of fractures. \nOnly operation is a total knee replacement on the left for arthritis and \nappendectomy. Bruises easily, frequently has headaches. Has been diagnosed \nas being bipolar. Exercises.\n \nRecent MRI consistent with a \"vasculopathy.\"\n \nFamily history. Mother died of colon cancer at 62, smoked. Father died \nat 62 of heart attack, stroke and insulin dependent diabetes, also \nsmoked. He is an only child.\n \nSocial history. Doesn't smoke. When he's depressed he becomes a binge \ndrinker. Exercises when he's not depressed. He's retired since 2103. Was \na stage manager.\n \nPhysical exam. Somewhat overweight gentleman. Blood pressure was 160/80. \nPulse was 88 and regular. Skin, a hint of livedo reticularis on \nforearms, and a couple of infected hair follicles around his knees. One \nsmall node in the left side of his neck. Mouth and throat was clear. \nBilateral nasal polyp more on the right than left. Ear drums fine. \nHearing fine (tuning fork in the middle of the forehead was heard in the \nforehead). Chest clear. No CVA tenderness. Heart: No murmurs. Abdomen, \nno organs, masses, tenderness but obese. Extremity, joint exam fine. \nNeurological fine.\n \nI do not think that his lupus has acted up but think most of his current \nsymptoms could be explained by an upper respiratory tract infection. \nHowever, I suspect he might have the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome \nand therefore have tested him for that, and also for complement level to \nalso exclude lupus and vasculitis. Basically I told him to take Flonase \ntwice a day until his ringing in the ear cleared up and postnasal drip \ncleared up. \n \nIn the meantime continue on the Lamictal 100 mg twice a day as a \nstabilizer, Risperdal 0.25 mg per day as a mood stabilizer, the \ntestolactone 50 mg 4 times a day to increase the availability of \ntestosterone, the Clomid (clomiphene citrate) 50 mg per day to decrease \nestradiol, Levoxyl 50 mcg twice a day, Altace 10 mg twice a day regarding \nhypertension, and ibuprofen 800 mg twice a day for low back pain. Patient \nalso gave me 2 pages of notes similar to what he had including comments \nregarding increased appetite, decreased memory, \nDr. Nunes \nRE:  Craft, Lloyd                             \nMRN: 26649180                        \nFebruary 17, 2114\nPage 3\n \n \ndecreased cognitive function, decreased balance, fatigue, decreased \nhearing, a history of carotid sinus, hypersensitivity, question of \ncholinergic transmission problems.\n \nAlso should be noted that a lot of his symptoms coincided with taking \nAricept to improve his memory.

As you know, he \nis a 64 year old, right-handed man with an extensive past medical \nhistory for a rheumatological disease.  His past medical history, \nbriefly, is that he was diagnosed with lupus in 2103 and at that \ntime he had a butterfly rash, he complained of chronic fatigue and \nhe also had what was considered temporal lobe seizures which were \ncharacterized as complex partial type events, and elevated double-\nstranded DNA of 1:80 and ANA of 1:512 with a homogenous pattern.  \nAll of these suggested that the patient did have lupus.  He was \ntreated for approximately three years with prednisone and he notes \nthat after medications were added by Dr. Taliyah Hoffman, his \nsymptoms and seizures went away.  Since that time, he has had a \nrecurrence of symptoms which includes fullness of his face and \nneck, pressure within his head.  He considers himself to have \nvascular headaches with facial weakness, ringing in his ears, \nnumbness and tingling of his left hand and arm, excessive \nsalivation and increased appetite. In describing his headache, he \nnoted that it is primarily a headache which is there every day and \nhas a combination of throbbing sensation as well as throbbing \nquality.  It is worse in the frontal temporal area and is not \nassociated with nausea, vomiting or paraesthesias.  There is no \nfamily history of migraines as well.  Also during his headache \nevents, he does not notice any decrease in his appetite or any \nnausea or vomiting.\n \nPast medical history:  As per above.  Medicval issues include \nbipolar II with ____________ diagnosed in 2110, hypothalamic \ngonadism, hypothalamic hypothyroidism and questionable history of \nmigraine headaches.  \n \nHis current medications include Lamictal, Risperdal, testolactone, \nchromisene, Levoxyl, Altace for hypertension, ibuprofen p.r.n. and \nprednisone p.r.n.  \n \nHe is allergic to penicillin, Lozol, bee stings and allopurinol.  \nThere is a questionable history to Aricept which he feels that the \nuse of this medication made his current symptoms come out of \nremission.\n \n \nBrice Short, M.D.\nRE:Craft, Lloyd\nMRN:26649180\n3-16-14\nPage 2\n \n \n \nFamily history is remarkable for insulin dependent diabetes \nmellitus in father and father also had heart disease.  \n \nSocial history:  He is a former stage manager.  \n \nNeurological exam:  He was awake, alert, oriented x 3.  Attention \nwas normal.  Speech was fluent, without dysarthria or paraphasic \nerrors.  There is no memory deficit or agnosia.  The patient gave \na very detailed history of events and no further detailed mental \nstatus testing was performed.  Cranial nerves:  Bilateral visual \nfields were full.  Disks were sharp.  Fundus was clear.  \nExtraocular movements were intact.  There was no nystagmus.  He \nhad normal facial sensation and symmetry.  Hearing was grossly \nnormal.  Uvula, tongue and palate were midline.  Motor examination \nrevealed normal tone and bulk with normal strength.  Deep tendon \nreflexes were symmetrical.  There was no upper motor neuron sign.  \nCoordination and gait were normal.  \n \nOverall impression:  64 year old, right-handed male with a history \nof lupus in the past.  His recent blood work shows that his \ndouble-stranded DNA was negative.  Taking into consideration his \ncurrent constellation of symptoms and his MRI reports that I \nevaluated which were completely normal except for small vascular \ndisease, at this time he does not fit with the diagnosis of \ncentral nervous system vasculitis.  He was told that he is at a \nhigh risk for having a stroke secondary to (1) having high blood \npressure and (2) having an elevated cholesterol.  If it is \npossible to maintain his blood pressure in good control and start \na cholesterol-lowering agent, he is to discuss this with you, and \nalso consider starting aspirin 81mg PO q.d. for primary prevention \nof heart disease.  He was informed that it is possible that there \nis some element of his immune system fluctuations and possibly his \nhormonal therapies may be contributing to some of his \nsymptomatology but the diagnosis or etiology of these symptoms is \nnot clear.  \n \nThank you for letting me take part in your patient's healthcare.\n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nClarence K.

Patient is being evaluated concurrently by a nutritionist and a psychologist.\n\n\n\nCC/ HPI:  Patient is a 69 year old male, with \n\nWeight:  213  ( 227  231 )   lbs   Height:    68   Inches   BMI: about  35 -> 32/33\n\nand with obesity-related complications as listed below.  Main concerns about weight include: \"I am overeating and can't stop\".  Pt says he can't stop eating after 3-4 pm, gets enraged, aggressive, anxious, restless, (was given barbiturate and Ativan prn for this, and has improved somewhat ~40%) eats 1/2 gallon of ice cream per day, eats as aggressively as he feels, ongoing for 1.5 yrs.  Afraid he will do something aggressive, and uses entering a \"food-coma\" to help restrain himself.  Has bipolar, is in \"mixed state\" now, with characteristics of both depr and mania.  Has neurendoc MD, thinking his pattern related to \"peak endocrine secretions\".\n\n\n\nHad binge drinking episodes till 2 yrs ago.  Drank for 2 days when switching into mania.  Learned to use substitution.  Learned to recognize mania coming on, prodrome, less need for sleep, euphoric speech, spending money.  Wife helped identify this.  Substituted going boating, listening to music, walking, talking to friends.\n\n\n\nWonders if substitution method can work for eating.  A potential method is to use 8 oz water or dietetic candy which have worked to satisfy his hunger.\n\n\n\nLearned aggression is PTSD.  Rel to betrayal by mother at age 13.  Trapped, helpless, boxed in.  Medical ailments make him feel the same way.\n\n\n\nHas has had talking therapy for ETOH, never for PTSD.\n\n\n\nThinks he may need therapy with wt loss program.\n\n\n\nNew hx:\n\nDoing well with indiv psych and nutrition (reviewed notes).\n\n\n\nWhen depressed uses food for comfort.\n\n\n\nAfternoon \"warewolf\" mode: every day 4-7 pm gets agitated, hostile, aggressive, hunger.  Hypothesized per neuroendocrine that cycles \"out of sync\".  Tried lorazepam, klonzepam.  Eats PB sandwich.  Would like something to reduce appetite during that time.  Has tried lots of water at the time, may work for him.\n\n\n\nRecent radiowave ablation for lumbar back pain.  Expect proced to help for 1-3 yrs.  Felt \"like a new man\" afterwards.  Was told it is now OK to exercise, has started exercise at gym.  Treadmill.  In addit to walking dog (not aerobic) 2 miles twice a day.  Now 2 goal is 3 times a week.

Along with the Neurology Residents, I personally interviewed, examined, and counseled the patient, confirmed the history and findings, reviewed records and studies, and discussed the impression and recommendations.  For greater details of H/P/ROS/meds/exam/labs/studies, and assessment &amp; plan, please refer to the neurology resident admit note by Dr. Robert Neil (and below under my assessment). \n\n\nROS performed across 10 systems are negative (as noted in neurology note) except as noted in Hx/Assessment and resident's note. \n\n\nCognitive and Elemental neurologic exam as noted in neurology resident note. \nOf note, AFVSS, was asleep but awoke to voice and became alert, attentive to examiner, but had moderate psychomotor retardation. Was slowly conversant and followed simple multiple step commands across midline. \nOriented to time/date/place. \nGreat d/w simple attention (MOY backwards only to Nov, skipped Oct went to September and then went forwards again). \nAble to perform complex attention and working memory bihemispheric Newberry location alpha-numeric task after a second trial. \nLanguage: fluent w/o dysarthria. Farily Intact naming for high and low frequency items except clasp and had some mild retrieval d/w. \nMemory: gives good details of recent events including hospitalizations. \nLeprosarium name and address: 5/5 registration --&gt; 2/5 recall in 5 min --&gt; 1/3 recognition from a list\nPresidential candidates = Xayarath and Golden\nCalculations: # of quarters in $6.75 = 27\nModerate d/w Luria fist-side-palm that improved w/ verbal cuing but still poor L&gt;R. \nNo EDSS, neglect, R-L confusion or apraxia. \nMood: \"low ... my daughter has cancer that spread to the bones\"; Affect: congruent. \n\n\nCN's II-XII intact, good up and down gaze and w/o IV or VI CN palsy. \nNo PND, abnl movements, tremor, asterixis, or UE ataxia. Slow but okay FFM, FNF, RAM. \nFull MS, nl DTR's and tone. Plantar responses flexor. \nMildly diminished stocking distributaion of LT/Cold/VS both legs to mid-shins. HKS mild d/w. \nUnable to stand w/ feet together even w/ eyes open. Moderate retropulsion trying to stand and moderate to severe retropulsion w/o spontaneously recovery on pull-test. Narraw base, small step size w/ low steppage, cautious and w/ retropulsion, slow rate w/ 10 step en bloc turning w/ imbalance (backwards). \nNo photo- or phono-phobia, no nuchal rigidity.\n\n\nLabs/Studies: of note BUN 21, Cr 1.2, MCV 95, Hct 41.6, wbc 13.3\n\n\nNeuroimaging: Personally reviewed HCT - mildly large vents, no s/o SDH or SAH or infarct/mass lx/hemorrhage. \n\n\nAssessment:: Likely Communicating Hydrocephalus with mild elevation of ICP in context of minor head trauma.  On exam shows psychomotor retardation, d/w concentration, retrieval (including memory and words), frontal fucntions including set-switching on Lurias, and working memory. He also has moderate retropulsion on exam worse on pull-test than spontaneously, and hypomimia. His vents are mildly dilated in context of general cerebral atrophy that is not o/w out-of-proportion for his advanced age. Onset of his sx's including bilateral headache described as constant 6-8/10 pressure at posterior vertex w/ occ. radiation foward made worse by lying down for some time (worse in the mornings) and better in the afternoons or after sitting or standing. No blurred vision but mild nausea w/o vomiting. No nuchal rigidity or photo-phonophobia. No f/c/ns/cp/sob/rash/weakness/changes in sensation. Describes very clear psychomotor retardation since first fall including d/w concentraion, memory and word retrieval, and extreme slowness in mental processing (including reading - used to be a speed reader and now reads one word at a time very slowly). He's had some urinary urgency but no incontinencey. Describes his d/w gait as not being able to get his legs to do what he wants them to do despite having good strength. Additionally, feels that he's always losing his balance backwards. No suggestion of meningoencephalitis, stroke or seizure. Had mild bilat tinnitus but no vertigo. Does ascribe rare very transient visual distortion and object movement (up/down). WBC mildly elevated but no fever and U/A and CXR are negative. \n\n\nOverall, there is a diad of gait apraxia and frontal cognitive dysfunction and psychomotor retardation (no urinary incontinence) in context of sx's of mildly elevated ICP and mildly enlarged vents. Has a mild small and large fiber distal symmetric polyneuropathy which exacerbates his gait difficulties. He is also at least mildly anxious and moderately anxious.  Had bradycardia in ED - now better but need to follow. \n\n\nPlan: \n\n- Optimize pain/headache control\n- Neuro checks q4hrs\n- Cardiac telemetry\n- Elevated ICP (mild) precautions with HOB &gt; 45 degrees; and gentle hydration (he is dehydrated by labs)\n- MRI of brain to better assess vents and possible transependymal flow, as well as to exclude much less likely brainstem and posterior fossa lesions. Also need to assess posterior circulation w/ MRA (had mild constant tinnutus), and assess for small SDH (b/o h/o head trauma). \n- check B12, homocysteine, TSH, ESR, hsCRP, ANA\n\n- After Brain MRI is reviewed, need to assess fundi, gait and cognition (formally score and time) and then perform diagnostic LP for hydrocephalus -- measuring opening and closing pressure after removing ~ 20cc and sending for cell count, glucose, TP, and xanthochromia as well as keeping ~ 10 cc. \n\n- Hold sotalol, complete cardiac/MI r/o by enzymes. \n- Follow wbc and monitor for s/s infection. \n\n\nDiscussed assessment and plan with pt and family who understand and agree. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Tejeda, M.D., Ph.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He has had a dry cough for about two months.  He was put on inhalers, but there was no improvement.  The cough is worse at night, but also he has it during the day.  He has no mucus production, no hemoptysis, no shortness of breath, and no wheezing.  He is a nonsmoker.  About a week ago, he was admitted to a local emergency room for chest pain.  He was rushed to Ochiltree General because of ST-T wave abnormalities on his EKG.  In retrospect, he has had these changes for many years, and anyway he had a cardiac catheterization, which showed mild obstruction of some of his coronary systems but no evidence of coronary artery syndrome.  He did have cardiomyopathy with the ejection fraction of 35%.  He was sent home on Toprol XL 50 mg QD, Lipitor 10 mg QD, lisinopril 10 mg, aspirin 325 mg once a day, and Avandia 2 mg once a day.  Since returning home, the patient feels no chest pain or shortness of breath.  No orthopnea or PND.  He still has a dry cough.\n\n\n\nChange in therapies and Renewals\n\nViagra 50mg  PRN QTY:15 Refills:3 Start: 10/05/2063\n\nAvandia 2 mg 1 tab   qd QTY:30 Refills:3 Start: 1/31/2065\n\naspirin 325 mg 1 tab   qd QTY:30 Refills:1 yr Start: 3/12/2065\n\nlisinopril 10 mg   QD Start: 8/4/2066\n\nLipitor 10mg po qd Start: 12/17/2066\n\nProventil two puffs inhaled qid QTY:1 cannister Refills:3 Start: 1/28/2067 End: 3/06/2067 prn - Inactivated\n\nToprol XL 50 mg po qd Start: 03/06/2067\n\nPrilosec 20mg po bid QTY:60 Refills:1 Start: 03/06/2067 take before meals\n\n\n\nPhysical examination\n\nBlood pressure 110/80  \n\nWeight   214 pounds\n\nGeneral appearance   Well-developed and well-nourished, no acute distress\n\nSkin   Clear\n\nHeent   Eyes, nonicteric.

His EF was 34%. He underwent cardiac cath which showed that the Left Main and LAD were patent, , a very distal LCX lesion. RCA was dominant and patent. The patient was discharged to home on a program of ace, BB, ASA and instructed to curtail his ETOH use. His EF improved to 66 %. He had repeat nuclear stress testing which showed small anterior infarct/small prior inferior infarct and was negative for ischemia in July 2068..\n   Since then he has had a stable angina pattern with chest pain brought on when he has to move very heavy objects in his work as a packager . This is usually relieved with one TNG. Most recently, he was seen by his PC Dr. Thomson and treated with Augmentin/Robitussin AC for a URI. He had a productive cough  and some chest discomfort related to coughing. \n   Most recently, he was brought into police custody for public intoxication. While in his jail cell,\"resting\" he developed the sudden onset on midsternal sharp chest pain accompanied by heavy breathing. There was no radiation to the arms, but he noted bilateral hand numbness. He also had palpitations and sweating and felt nauseated. He received one sl TNG. An ambulance was called and he received 2 TNG sprays. His pain diminished. His BP was 176/100 at the time. He was brought to the Evanston Hospital ER and found to have \"high lateral changes\" on his EKG's. Troponins were slightly elevated at .13- considered a \"gray zone\" for the hospitals range  for MI. The patient was pain free after a dose of Morphine. While in the hospital, he was placed on suicide watch. He has a history of a suicide attempt 3 years ago and has previously had counseling and been on antidepressants. He has a son who is in a vegetative state after an MVA whom he helps care for and this is very stressful. His recent arrest made hiite despondent. At Evanston Hospital, he was started on a beta blocker and Lovenox. He had a suboptimal stress test which was stopped because of SSCP and nausea. He is now transferred to OGH for further evaluation.\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n   diabetes\nCardiomyopathy(?ETOH related)\nCAD- 50 % LCX lesion 3/67\nDepression with suicide attempt 3 years ago- was on antidepressants until 6 months ago\nObesity\n\n\n\t\n\n\tChanges to Allergies\n\t\nNo known allergies\nNo known drug allergy\n\n\n\tMedications (Confirmed):\n\n\t\naspirin  325 mg daily\nAugmentin  500mg/125mg po q8h x 10 days\nLevitra  20mg po daily PRN\nLipitor  10 mg daily\nlisinopril  40 mg daily\nmetformin hydrochloride  500 mg daily\nPatanol 0.1% eye drops \nPrilosec  20 mg daily\nRobitussin ac  100mg/10mg/5ml po q4-6h PRN cough\nSynalar ointment  0.025%\nVoltaren  75 mg BID PRN\n\n\n\tFamily history:\n   non contributory\n\n\n\tSocial history:\n   working until recently- was \"packaging manager for Johnson & Johnson\"\n no smoking\n rare etoh- one glass red wine with evening meal\nLives with wife/2 daughters- has son in vegetative state after car accident whom family cares for\n\n\n\tReview of systems:\n   see above. remainder negative in detail\n\nPhysical examination:\n\t\n-BMI: 42.6  Obese, high risk\n-Pulse: 62  bpm\n-weight: 225  lbs.\n-Neck:   jvp 6 cm without bruits\n-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.\n-Cardiac:   Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced.

EKG changes and  \"intermediate\"Troponins per local hospital assay.Case reviewed with Dr. Levine. Would continue ASA, beta Blocker and Lisinopril in addition to usual meds. He has previous CAD and is diabetic. Even though stess test was suboptimal, he has risk factors of diabetes, obesity and hypertension, and 50 % LCX lesion , so would proceed with cath tomorrow. NPO after midnight for cath lab. He is currently pain free so no heparin for now. Would check serial EKG;s, and troponins in addition to usual labs. Please obtain fasting cholesterol panel.\n\nWill need psychiatric consult to aseess suicidality though he currently denies this.\n\nAgree hold NSAIDs/Voltaren intil after cath.\n\n\t\nFlorene Kim, NP\n\n\t\nTranscribed by: Florene Kim\n\n\t\nSigned electronically by  Florene Kim, NP\nDocument Status: Final\n\n\n\n",

At that point, he noted increasing chest pressure and dyspnea on minimal exertion. Following a positive stress test, he was admitted for cardiac catheterization. Coronary angiography revealed severe multi vessel CAD. He had an IABP placed and underwent cardiac surgical evaluation. Carotid non-invasive studies revealed a moderate right carotid lesion with mild left carotid disease. \n\nHe underwent a 4 vessel CABG by Dr. Troyer. His graft anatomy includes a LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the PDA and PLV and a SVG to the OM branch. He required re-exploration for bleeding. He also had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, treated with Amiodarone. His IABP was removed a few days post operatively. He developed new anterior ST changes, and an echocardiogram revealed a marked decline in his LV function from 66% to 19%. \n\nHe was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab. Coronary angiography revealed a widely patent SVG to OM, a 30% ostial lesion in the SVG to the PDA and PLV. The LIMA was patent, but there was no flow into the distal LAD. He underwent stenting of the LIMA anastomosis into the LAD with a 2.5mm x 18mm, 2.5mm x 12mm and 2.5mm x 12mm MiniVision stents. \n\nHis post cardiac surgical course was further complicated by a Serratia pneumonia and a transient worsening renal function. He also required sternal rewiring for sternal instability. He was followed by Dr. Hardin. His HIT assay was borderline negative. He was also found to have a factor VII deficiency, and was treated with argatroban. Lower extremity non-invasive studies revealed a R posterior tibial DVT, and he was discharged on Fopndaparinux. A follow up echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 31% with apical akinesis, with only mild mitral regurgitation. He was discharged to rehab on post operative day 20. \n\nHe was discharged from rehab on June 5th. On June 7th he was lightheaded and found to be hypotensive by the VNA. His systolic pressures were 78 to 90 mmHg, and his lisinopril was decreased and his Lasix dose was cut in half. He denies any chest discomfort, throat or arm discomfort or palpitations. He denies any PND, but has been sleeping in a hospital bed with the head elevated 45 degrees. The family updated the office earlier this morning - 2 pound weight gain and shortness of breath. His Lasix was increased to 40 mg bid. However, when seen by VNA, his room air saturation was 76%. 911 was called and he was brought to WGCC ED for evaluation. \n\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n   CM/CAD as described, Hypertension, Type II DM x 15 yrs- with nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy, Mild renal insufficiency, PVD, Carotid disease, Factor VII Deficiency, BPH, Hearing loss, Vitamin B12 deficiency. \n\nPSH: CABG 5/01/97, Cataract OD.\n\n\t\n\n\tChanges to Allergies\n\t\nNKA: No Known Allergies - reaction: [reviewed]\n\n\n\tMedications (Confirmed):\n\n\t\naspirin  81mg po daily - took 4 this AM\natenolol  25mg po bid\nfondaparinux  5mg sc daily\nglyburide  5mg po daily\nLasix  40mg po bid\nmagnesium oxide  800 mg po tid\nmultivitamins  1 tab po daily\nomeprazole  20mg po daily\nPlavix  75mg po daily\npotassium chloride  10mEq po daily\nregular insulin  sliding scale sc tid\nsimvastatin  80mg po qpm\ntrazodone  50mg x 1/2 tab po at bedtime\nvitamin b12  1000 mcg po daily\n\n\n\tFamily history:\n   F deceased with cardiomyopathy at 64; M deceased with CA at 54; 1 B at 85 with CVA; 1 S at 87 with CHF.\n\n\n\tSocial history:\n   Married, 6 adult children, retired Geochemist. \nTobacco: Quit 2062; ETOH: None; Caffeine: 1-2 cups/day; Exercise: Very limited since discharge.\n\n\n\tReview of systems:\n   Negative for: Frequent headaches, recent visual changes, TIA, CVA, syncope, asthma, Liver disease, anemia. \n\nPositive for: as stated, Laser treatment OU April 97, Hx of asbestosis, Remote PUD, Clotting disorder, PVD - with bilateral claudication at 1 block.\n\nPhysical examination:\n\t\n-Pulse: 78  \n-resp. rate: 20  100% on 2L\n-General:   A&amp;O, well developed, fatigued appearing elderly male in NAD.\n-Skin:   Pale, warm and dry.\n-HEENT:   NC/AT.

Initial cardiac enzyme screen is negative, but BNP markedly elevated. Based on exam, suspect a combination of CHF and pleural effusions (diuretic medication was not being taken at prescribed dose accidentally). Will admit for diuresis, if significant effusion not improving with diuretics, may need thoracentesis. If BP allows, will resume low dose ACEI tomorrow. Check echocardiogram to assess EF and pericardial effusion. continue aspirin and Plavix. \n\nRecent DVT - on Fondaparinux - please continue and ask Dr. Hardin to see while in-patient (known to him). \n\nDM - continue current regimen, follow and cover as needed.\n\n\t\nHelen T.

Agree with assessment and plan.\n\nIn brief, 81 M with recent CABG admitted for increasing SOB with PND and orthopnea, probably 2/2 pleural effusion.  On P/E on clinical signs of left heart failure.\n\nPlan: CXR, diuresis, +/- pleural tap.\n\n\t\nOra-Jordan Yelton, MD pager #33436\n\n\t\nSigned electronically by Ora-Jordan Yelton, MD\n\n\t\t\tDocument Status: Final with Addendum\n\t\t\n\n\n\n",
