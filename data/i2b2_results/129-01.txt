She's doing much better from her painful R facial weakness (? ****** **** syndrome).  She ** **** take tegretol, but rather increased her amytriptiline and added some darvocet acutely, now off these meds.  Her R eye "tears a lot", at no particular time (ie, not necessarily when she's masticating), and occasionally it burns....but she has not developed conjunctivitis or ocular redness or discharge.  She has difficulty chewing opn the R side of her mouth, and finds she"pockets" food in her R cheek; she manages by chewing on L, and swallowing frequently, especially taking extra liquids.

The pain has *******-  she now only gets "a twinge" now and then.



******* has noticed she's not hearing quite as well.



Her current meds include amitryptiline 25 hs, mevacor 20, procardia 30 bid, furosemide 40x3, isosorbide 20 qd allopurinol 300 qd.  She's releived to learn the results of her recent blood work, including BUN 65 Creat 3.4, Hct 29.8



On exam, she has gained weight since I last saw her; she comes in ***** wheelchair, but is able to take a few steps with her straight cane, and climb onto the examining ****** with only contact guard. Dense ********; fundi not visualized; EOMS full without ptosis or nystagmus. ******** are brisk ***********, but she has decreased *********** the R lower facial segments (V1, V2); excellent masseter and temporalis strength. R lower facial weakness, with less evident weakness of orbicularis oculi; he manages to close the eyelid almost completely; + ****'s phenomenon.  She hears finger rub at 90 cm on R, 70 cm on *; ***** *********** to the R, but *****' positive ************ (ie, AC>BC **). Tongue midline.  ********* voice well.  TMs opaque, but **** clear.



She has a marked polyneuropathy, with decreased vibration from ******** to elbows bilaterally Hyporeflexia throughout, but symmetrical.  Strength remains well conserved.



IMP: improving * ****'s. MRI showed much motion, but no gross abnormalities



Plan- continue with current management. I'd welcome the ********** of seeing her again in about 6 months.
