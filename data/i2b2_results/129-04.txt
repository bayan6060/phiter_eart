Chief Complaint	

72 year old lady w hx ESRD on HD, adm with SOB, no CP, positive troponin and non-specific ST-TW changes. 



History of Present Illness	



Ms ****** is a 72 year old lady without significant past CAD who presented to the ER because of increasing SOB with minimal exercise.  She says she has been SOB  for 50 years  however in the last week or so, has noticed increased ***, now w minimal exercise.  No CP, palpitations, sweating, cough, sputum, fever, haemoptysis.  Sleeps in a chair for last number of years.  No ankle swelling.



Called *** and was given s/l TNG x * *** ** w effect.  In ER was given ASA and metoprolol 5mg iv. Refused **********, insulin and heparin. Had positive troponin 0.19 -  previous troponin in system was 18 months ago  - 0.04.  Transferred to CCU as no beds available in ***

CXR

To my eye, cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions, bilateral lower zone reticulo-nodular exam.



ECGs

Sinus 76. Left ward axis, normal intervals. LVH by voltage w QRS of 125, TWI in 1, aVL, laterally.  Somewhat worsened from *** in *******.

PERICARDIUM       ****



MITRAL VALVE

There is evidence of thickening of the anterior mitral leaflet.  There is

calcification of the anterior and posterior mitral annulus.  There is no

evidence of mitral valve prolapse.  The peak transmitral gradient is 10 mmHg.

The mean transmitral gradient is 5 mmHg.  There is mild to moderate mitral

regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler.

LEFT ATRIUM

The left atrium is dilated.



AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT

Multiple aortic leaflets are thickened but there is no stenosis.  The aortic

valve is tricuspid.  There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or

spectral Doppler.



LEFT VENTRICLE

The left ventricular cavity size is normal.  The left ventricular systolic

function approaches the lower limits of normal.  There is symmetric left

ventricular hypertrophy.  There is segmental apical left ventricular

dysfunction (see wall motion plot).  There is no evidence of left ventricular

thrombus.  The estimated ejection fraction is 51 %.



TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC

There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency.



RIGHT VENTRICLE

The right ventricle is not dilated.  The right ventricular systolic function

is within normal limits.



PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES

There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.  There is a space between

visceral and parietal pericardium most c/w pericardial fat.



CONCLUSIONS

Compared to the study of */**/**, the EF has dropped by 10% and apical wall

motion abnormalities are now noted.





CCU Course/Plan	

72 year old woman with ESRD, positive troponin in setting SOB and pulmonary oedema on CXR. Suspect  leak  from demand.  



1)	ischemia: ***, **. Would doubt she needs urgent cath but will hold NPO for potential cath in am.  Would not add heparin. Check fasting lipids.



2)	rhythm: so far not an issue. ** as tolerated. 



3)	pump: she has LVH and likely diastolic dysfunction.  Would prefer to have ACE on board - will d/w renal as to why not.



4)	ESRD - can go for HD today. Need to contact dialysis unit to arrange time.



5)	DM 2 - SSI for now, will likely give back Lantus tonight. She is v reluctant to have SSI, will give at half usual doses.



6)	FEN cardiac, diabetic diet. Hold NPO pending possible cath in am.



7)	Prophylaxis: GI: Nexium, DVT: Heparin IV; BM: prn. 



8)	***** - to SDU today
