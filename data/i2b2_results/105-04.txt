EKG- from e.r. TWI in II, III, avF, v3-v6. borderline LVH, left atrial enlargement

On admission - flattened TW in II, II,avF, TWI v4, v5



Imp: 66 y.o. male with hx of DM, autonomic instability, incr. Cholesterol presents with new EKG changes.



Plan:

1.C-V

a)	ischemia - r/o MI, first set of cardiac enzymes negative, will get two more sets to r/o. **** monitor for EKG changes. New TWI in inferior and lateral chest leads worrisome in a patient with multiple risk factors. Last stress negative 6 months ago. **** talk with PCP and team in a.m. to discuss the need for stress in asymptomatic patient with recent stress. EKG changes may be secondary to htn strain. **** d/c IV heparin. Cont. po lopressor as long as patient's bp tolerates it. ASA qd. Appreciate input of Dr. ******* and will discuss future management.

b)	**** - last ef 59% pt. Appears euvolemic

c)	Rhythm - no hx of arrythmia, on cardiac monitor/telemetry overnight



2. HTN - pt. Htn when he arrived on floor. Hx of hypotension. **** give low dose lopressor 12.5mg BID as well as nitropaste. Need to be careful of lowering BP too fast. Pt.'s bp unstable in past.  **** hold florinef and proamatine for now



3. DM - hx of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. **** maintain on home ******* of nph, and cover with iss.



4. Shoulder pain - ultram, PT 



5. Resp - opacity in ***, may be secondary to old TB. According to radiologist reading it has changed since past x-rays. Asymptomatic. Can be worked up as an outpatient.
