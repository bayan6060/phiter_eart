He has done well since that procedure.  He denies any exertional chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, PND, orthopnea, pedal edema, lightheadedness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness.

	Other Data:
   The patient underwent exercise tolerance testing in ****** **** and was able to exercise for 6 minutes.  He had no chest pain.  Nuclear images showed no evidence of ischemia or previous infarct.  LV function was normal.
EKG today shows normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, right bundle-branch block, and an old IMI.


	Assessment and plan:
   In summary, this is a very pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who had an MI in **** ****, which was a non-ST-elevation MI.  He underwent stenting of his LAD.  Since that time, he has not had any exertional angina.  He has no evidence of fluid retention or decompensated congestive heart failure.  Blood pressure is fine today.  Cholesterol is not perfect, but acceptable.  He is on a high dose of atorvastatin.  He is on a good medical regimen and at this point, I would keep him on his current medicines and plan to see him back in another six months.  He would like to enter a Cardiac Rehab Program and I think that certainly is a reasonable thing to do.

As always, it is a pleasure to be able to participate in the care of this very pleasant gentleman.

**** personal regards,

Sincerely yours,
