CC: chest pain

 

HPI: 71M hx DM, HLP, HTN, p/w chest pain. Pt reports having markedly reduced right eye visual acuity this evening, subsequently became increasingly anxious and    nervous    and developed chest tightness across chest at level of xiphoid.

Imaging:

CXR (*/**/**): No acute process



EKG: NSR. LBBB. 1mm STD I/II/aVf/V5-6. 2mm STE V1-3. TWI I, biphasic T-wave V5-6. (No change from prior ekg)



Impression: 71M hx DM, HTN, HLP, p/w chest pain likely GI related and not cardiac in origin.



Plan: 

1.	chest pain: Unlikely cardiac in origin given negative EKG, recent normal stress test, and atypical nature. Likely GI related as pt with dry heaving around time of chest tightness.

-cont asa, simvastatin, atenolol, irbesartan, and lasix

-repeat EKG in AM

-cycle cardiac enzymes, telemetry

-check lipid panel

-maalox prn



2.	decreased visual acuity: Most likely worsening macular degeneration given recent chronic history of symptoms. Absence of pain makes retinal vascular occlusion very unlikely, no other neurological symptoms to indicate CVA. 

-refer pt back to *** once ruled out for MI

-consider I- CT if more neuro symptoms develop to r/o acute stroke



3.	Diabetes: -check lipid panel, hemoglobin A1c

-****, glipizide

-hold pioglitazone (not in formulary)



4.	proph: nexium, heparin
