RE: ****, ***
MRN: *******
DOB: **/**/****


Dear Dr. ******, 


I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. *** in the office today. As you recall, he is a very pleasant 71-year-old gentleman with a history of right-sided trigeminal neuralgia. He has pain behind the right eye that has been present for 3 years. He describes it as a very sharp, severe, stabbing pain. He takes Tegretol, which helps but does not completely alleviate the pain. Over the past month the pain has become worse and increasingly intolerable. He has increased his Tegretol dose to 800 mg per day, which is about the limit of what he can tolerate. 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes, asthma. 


MEDICATIONS: *************, ******, Tegretol, glyburide and metformin. 


ALLERGIES: None. 


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Cholecystectomy. 


SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is retired, a laboratory technician and lives in **********.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Noncontributory. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pleasant, older man in mild distress secondary to the pain. His mental status, cranial nerve examination, strength and sensation were normal. 


IMPRESSION AND PLAN: In summary, this is a patient with what seems to be right V1 trigeminal neuralgia. The fact that he responded to the Tegretol is encouraging. I discussed the different options with him including no surgery, radiofrequency rhizotomy, and microvascular decompression. He elected to proceed with a microvascular decompression. I discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient and all his questions were answered. A surgical consent was obtained. The plan is to perform the surgery on **/**/****. Prior to proceeding, I would like to obtain a dedicated brain MRI with fine cuts through the posterior fossa to better assess the neurovascular anatomy. 


I thank you very much and look forward to hearing from you in the future.
