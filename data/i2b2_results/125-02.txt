At that time, he had been on glyburide, metformin and Avandia, his new PCP increased his glyburide and his Avandia.  He also stopped his hydrochlorothiazide out of concern that this is not an ideal agent for a diabetic patient. Over the next weeks to months, the patient had progressive peripheral edema, fluid weight gain and ultimately development of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  He returned for care and was started on furosemide and has been recently titrated up to a dose of 60 mg orally on this.  He self adjusted his Avandia dose from 4 mg twice daily to 2 mg daily.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 61-year-old gentleman with type II diabetes complicated by retinopathy and erectile dysfunction.  He has had inadequate glycemic control on oral agents which are currently at their maximal doses given the intolerable side effects of Avandia.  He has plans for elective knee replacement during the ****** and we have advised him that before he consider that he should get his diabetes under better control, should make sure his blood pressure is controlled and should seek cardiac evaluation, especially given his history of pulmonary edema symptoms on Avandia.



1.  We will start insulin today initially NPH 25 units at bedtime to replace his evening dose of glyburide.  We have instructed him on use of the ****** for insulin administration.  He will continue his glyburide 10 mg each morning, continue metformin 1000 mg twice daily and Avandia 2 mg each morning.  We will check hemoglobin A1c today as a baseline. We will follow up to determine appropriate titration of his insulin as well as addition of other doses during the day.

2.  His blood pressure is not optimally controlled at this time.  We will increase his lisinopril to 40 mg daily. He will continue his furosemide 60 mg daily and he will continue to titrate his Lasix dosing at the guidance of his primary care doctor.

3.  His last microalbumin to creatinine ratio and creatinine were normal.  Testing is up-to-date.

4.  The patient has an LDL that was above target this ****** and Lipitor was initiated; however, he has not been on this long enough to see an effect. At his next visit, we will reevaluate his lipids to determine if his Lipitor needs titration.

5.  He is overdue for an eye exam and will contact Dr. ****** at ******* him to have this done.

6.  We have made a referral to Dr. **** ******* for cardiology evaluation.  We have ordered an echocardiogram to be performed prior to this visit. We have also referred the patient to a number of possible PCPs in the OMC/CBC system. 



The patient was advised to return to the office in two months for follow up.
