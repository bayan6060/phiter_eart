RE:  ***** *******
     ** #***-**-**-*
 
Dear Dr. ***:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. ******* in follow-up today. 
Overall, he is doing very well from a cardiovascular perspective. 
Unfortunately, he continues to gain weight but overall he is doing
well. 
 
His current medical regimen includes cyclosporin 150 b.i.d.,
prednisone 6 mg q.d., Imuran 275 q.d., Cardizem CD 300 mg q.d.,
Cardura 4 mg q.d., one baby aspirin a day, Axid 150 b.i.d.,
pravachol 20 q.d., magnesium oxide 250 mg b.i.d., calcium and
vitamin D, insulin NPH 54 units and 10 Regular in the morning, 32
units of NPH and 8 of Regular in the evening.  
 
On physical examination, he was obese.  Blood pressure of 150/90
with a heart rate of 85, weight was 305 pounds which is increased
5 pounds from ********* ****.  Chest was clear to auscultation and
percussion.  Cardiac exam reveals a flat JVP at 30 degrees, a non-
displaced PMI with a normal S1, S2 without murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.  His abdomen
is obese, soft and nontender.  It is difficult to appreciate any
organomegaly.  There is no hepatojugular reflux.  Extremities are
without edema. 
 
Electrocardiogram reveals normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 85. 
Intervals of .16/.08/.34 with an axis of 60 degrees.  This is a
normal tracing unchanged from previous tracing.
 
Therefore, Mr. ******* is doing well from a cardiovascular
perspective.  We will make the necessary adjustments in his medical
regimen according to his laboratory results.  Unfortunately, he did
take his cyclosporin this morning and therefore he will mail his
labs back to us.
 
I did discuss with him attempting some weight loss with portion
control.  I think it might work to give him some reasonable goals
such as a weight loss of 30 pounds as ******* to 130.

Mr. ******* will return in ******* for a biopsy and clinic visit.  
**** regards.
 
Sincerely,
