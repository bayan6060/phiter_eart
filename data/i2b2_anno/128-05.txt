Impression:  pulmonary veno occulsive disease, diastolic dysfunction with mild CHF exacerbation.  Her resting O2 sats are back to baseline and she does not appear to be in significant decompensated failure.  Unfortunately, we don't have much more to offer her in the way of cure (she has declined other interventions with pulmonlogist), as this is generally a terminal illness.

--admit to medicine for further obs on tele.

--complete cycling enzymes

--continue outpatient lasix dose.

--adjust n/c oxygen as needed

--pulm/pt rehab consult -- pt has declined inpt rehab, but whatever might be offered as outpt would be helpful.

--i will speak with her re: potential for hospice care since she has declined inpt rehab at last and with this admission.  This might help forgo further hosptilizations with similar treatment at home.

--Continue DM treatment w/ glucophage/glyburide.

--anticipate d/c in 1-2 days.

-- pls offer pneumovax if she'll accept it.

-- hold coumadin, recheck INR (pls have anticoag clinic leave note with dosing of coumadin)

CXR: 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and mild interstitial pulmonary edema, consistent with CHF. 2.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.





EKG: no ischemic changes



Impression:  pulmonary veno occulsive disease, diastolic dysfunction with mild CHF exacerbation.  Her resting O2 sats are back to baseline and she does not appear to be in significant decompensated failure.  Unfortunately, we don't have much more to offer her in the way of cure (she has declined other interventions with pulmonlogist), as this is generally a terminal illness.



Plan:



--admit to medicine for further obs on tele.

--complete cycling enzymes

--continue outpatient lasix dose.

--adjust n/c oxygen as needed

--pulm/pt rehab consult -- pt has declined inpt rehab, but whatever might be offered as outpt would be helpful.

--i will speak with her re: potential for hospice care since she has declined inpt rehab at last and with this admission.  This might help forgo further hosptilizations with similar treatment at home.

--Continue DM treatment w/ glucophage/glyburide.

--anticipate d/c in 1-2 days.

-- pls offer pneumovax if she'll accept it.

-- hold coumadin, recheck INR (pls have anticoag clinic leave note with dosing of coumadin)

CXR: 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and mild interstitial pulmonary edema, consistent with CHF. 2.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.





EKG: no ischemic changes



Impression:  pulmonary veno occulsive disease, diastolic dysfunction with mild CHF exacerbation.  Her resting O2 sats are back to baseline and she does not appear to be in significant decompensated failure.  Unfortunately, we don't have much more to offer her in the way of cure (she has declined other interventions with pulmonlogist), as this is generally a terminal illness.



Plan:



--admit to medicine for further obs on tele.

--complete cycling enzymes

--continue outpatient lasix dose.

--adjust n/c oxygen as needed

--pulm/pt rehab consult -- pt has declined inpt rehab, but whatever might be offered as outpt would be helpful.

--i will speak with her re: potential for hospice care since she has declined inpt rehab at last and with this admission.  This might help forgo further hosptilizations with similar treatment at home.

--Continue DM treatment w/ glucophage/glyburide.

--anticipate d/c in 1-2 days.

-- pls offer pneumovax if she'll accept it.

-- hold coumadin, recheck INR (pls have anticoag clinic leave note with dosing of coumadin)

--i will speak with her re: potential for hospice care since she has declined inpt rehab at last and with this admission.  This might help forgo further hosptilizations with similar treatment at home.

--Continue DM treatment w/ glucophage/glyburide.

EKG: no ischemic changes



Impression:  pulmonary veno occulsive disease, diastolic dysfunction with mild CHF exacerbation.  Her resting O2 sats are back to baseline and she does not appear to be in significant decompensated failure.  Unfortunately, we don't have much more to offer her in the way of cure (she has declined other interventions with pulmonlogist), as this is generally a terminal illness.



Plan:



--admit to medicine for further obs on tele.

--complete cycling enzymes

--continue outpatient lasix dose.

--adjust n/c oxygen as needed

--pulm/pt rehab consult -- pt has declined inpt rehab, but whatever might be offered as outpt would be helpful.

--i will speak with her re: potential for hospice care since she has declined inpt rehab at last and with this admission.  This might help forgo further hosptilizations with similar treatment at home.

--Continue DM treatment w/ glucophage/glyburide.

--anticipate d/c in 1-2 days.

-- pls offer pneumovax if she'll accept it.

-- hold coumadin, recheck INR (pls have anticoag clinic leave note with dosing of coumadin)

-- OOB to chair, ambulate with assistance.
